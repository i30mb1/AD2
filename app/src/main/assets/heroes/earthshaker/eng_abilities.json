The segments have a collision size of 24 and a distance of 8.25 between each other, with the first one being placed 8.25 range in front of Earthshaker. This means the Fissure's effective blocking area is 1350 ( 1743.75) range long and 24 range wide. Every unit (except wards and buildings) which is within that area upon cast is pushed aside.","The stun and damage are applied in a circular shape around each segment. This means the total damage\/stun area consists of multiple overlapping circles, and not a smooth line. A unit can only be hit by one instance per cast, even when within the damage\/stun radius of multiple segments.

It may only target the ground or self. Double-clicking the ability automatically targets self. When targeting self, the ability behaves like the unupgraded version, using the 0.69 + 0.57 second cast animation and not leaping. When targeting the ground, it uses a 0 second cast time and a 0.2 second cast backswing, during which Earthshaker is disabled. The leap duration is always the same, so the speed adapts based on the targeted distance. The leap height is always 562 range. During the leap, Earthshaker is fully disabled, unable to move, turn, attack or cast spells or items. The spell counts as cast as soon as the leap starts. However, Aftershock and the totem buff are applied upon landing. Aftershock and the totem buff are applied even when Earthshaker gets disabled or dies during the leap. Getting hit by other sources of forced movement causes the leap's trajectory to change, but it is not interrupted. However, getting hit by forced movement causes the ability to not apply Aftershock or the totem buff upon landing. The spell is fully and immediately canceled when getting moved upwards or teleported by other spells. While in the air, other units may pass below Earthshaker.

Unlike those other entities, he created himself through an act of will, and serves no other master. In restless slumbers, encased in a deep seam of stone, he became aware of the life drifting freely above him. He grew curious. During a season of tremors, the peaks of Nishai shook themselves loose of avalanches, shifting the course of rivers and turning shallow valleys into bottomless chasms. When the land finally ceased quaking, Earthshaker stepped from the settling dust, tossing aside massive boulders as if throwing off a light blanket. He had shaped himself in the image of a mortal beast, and named himself Raigor Stonehoof. He bleeds now, and breathes, and therefore he can die. But his spirit is still that of the earth; he carries its power in the magical totem that never leaves him. And on the day he returns to dust, the earth will greet him as a prodigal son.","talentsTips":["The mana talent increases maximum mana capacity, and keeps the current mana percentage.","This attack damage talent is added as raw attack damage, so it does not benefit illusions, and is not affected by most percentage-based damage increasing or reducing effects.","The armor talent does not benefit illusions.","The magic resistance talent stacks multiplicatively with other sources of magic resistance.","The magic resistance talent increases Earthshaker's magic resistance to 62.5%."],"trivia":["Earthshaker's response \"Chaos Dunk!\" is a reference to the freeware RPG game Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden.","Earthshaker is possibly named after the weapon \"Earthshaker\" from World of Warcraft, known for its AoE stun."],"talents":["-2s Enchant Totem Cooldown:+50% Magic Resistance","+400 Fissure Range:+50 Echo Damage","+7 Armor:+30 Movement Speed","+250 Mana:+30 Damage"],"desc":"Raigor Stonehoof, the Earthshaker, is a melee strength hero with several area of effect (AoE) disables, commonly played as a ganker or initiator. Good usage of his spells allow him to damage and chainstun multiple enemies at once, making him very disruptive in skirmishes and teamfights. His Fissure is a versatile long-ranged spell that affects enemies in a line, used to stun, inflict moderate damage, and create an impassable wall of earth for a significant duration. Proper usage of this can allows him to cut off chokepoints, leaving enemies with no escape routes or preventing them from chasing after endangered allies. Enchant Totem massively boosts his attack damage for one attack, and has a very short cooldown. Aftershock lets the Earthshaker deal additional damage and stun in a small area around him every time he uses one of his spells, and combos particularly well with Enchant Totem, given the former's very low cooldown. Earthshaker's heavy AoE-centric kit is most powerful when his enemies are in large numbers and in close proximity. With his Echo Slam, he can deal heavy damage to clusters of enemies. All of Earthshaker's spells (with the exception of his ultimate) have a long casting animation, but with proper positioning, an adept Earthshaker can wreak havoc. Blink Dagger is an essential item for him to be able to properly land Echo Slam within a cluster of enemies. At the same time, because of the high mana costs of his spells, he needs some form of mana sustenance. With his tremendous seismic power, the Earthshaker is never one that should be taken lightly even when he is heavily outnumbered."}

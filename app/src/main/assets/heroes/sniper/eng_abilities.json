The debuff lasts 4 seconds, or until the projectile lands, or the cast gets canceled. The debuff grants shared vision with the targeted unit. Does not provide any vision when targeting neutral creeps. The debuff grants True Sight over the target, meaning it cannot be canceled or be disjointed with invisibility without True Sight immunity.

However, upon reaching the cast point only heroes, illusions and creep-heroes are hit by projectiles. Other targeted units are not hit. Since the vision debuff disappears only when the projectile hits, or the cast gets canceled, it lasts for the full 4 seconds on all other targets. Unlike the default version, the upgraded Assassinate fully ignores invulnerable units, neither initially targeting them, nor launching a projectile. All targets are marked upon cast. Entering or leaving the area during the cast time has no effect. While the single-target version is subject to the motion buffer range, the area targeted version is not, so that distance cannot cancel the cast. This means even if an enemy teleports away after being marked, Sniper still launches the projectile towards them. If no valid targets are within the area, the spell still gets cast, wasting mana and cooldown.","Aghanim's Scepter causes Sniper to perform an instant attack on all targets.

Sharpeye was among the best of these strange folk for whom projectile weapons are but another appendage, and to shoot is as natural as to touch. On his day of summoning, when he was to gain full standing in his village, Sharpeye took the ancient test: a single shot from the valley floor to strike a beast down from the cliffs. To miss was to be dishonored. With his entire village standing vigil, Sharpeye took his shot. A steepstalker fell; the crowd cheered. But when the carcass was collected, the village grew silent, for the elders found that the bullet had pierced its glittering central eye then fallen to be clenched in the steepstalker's mandibles. This ominous sign was the literal opening of a dark prophecy, foretelling both greatness and exile for the gunman who made such a shot. Sharpeye the Sniper was thus, by his own skill, condemned to make his way apart from his people\u2014and unwelcome back among them until he has fulfilled the remainder of the prophecy by attaining legendary stature on a field of battle.","talentsTips":["This attack damage talent is added as raw attack damage, so it does not benefit illusions, and is not affected by most percentage-based damage increasing or reducing effects.","The cooldown reduction talent stacks multiplicatively with Octarine Core and additively other sources of cooldown reduction."],"trivia":["A number of Sniper's lines are either direct quotations or paraphrases of lines used by the Sniper class in Team Fortress 2, a popular class-based shooter also by Valve.

As long as there are two heroes left on the battlefield, someone is gonna want someone dead.","One of Sniper's lines while bottling a rune is \"Jarate!\", which is a reference to Team Fortress 2 in-game weapon for Sniper class, Jarate.","One of Sniper's lines while casting his ultimate is \"Boom headshot!\", which is a reference to the Pure Pwnage mockumentary series.","Incidentally, his voice actor, Gary Schwartz, also voices the Heavy Weapons Guy and Demoman in Team Fortress 2.","Sniper's line, \" Inconceivable!\" is likely a reference to Vizzini's catchphrase in the film The Princess Bride due to the similarities in both the appearance and voices of the two.","Sniper's name, Kardel Sharpeye, is a reference to professional Counter-Strike player Kyle \"Ksharp\" Miller of team 3D, who is regarded for his skillful AWP (Sniper rifle) use. Sniper's ultimate, Assassinate, also uses the same, though slightly modified gunshot sound as Counter-Strike's AWP.","Sniper's fun name in DotA was Vasily Zaitsev, a highly skilled Russian sniper who was active during World War 2.","Sniper's line, \" What a dum-dum!\" is a pun on the Expanding bullet, also known as a dum-dum.

With no escape mechanism, poor mobility, and only a modest health pool, Sniper is exceptionally frail at all stages of the game and vulnerable to enemies who confront him head-on. However, his abilities provide him both the means to keep his distance and systematically destroy his enemies from afar. Shrapnel is a potent, high-cast range zoning ability that provides vision for Sniper while slowing and damaging enemies in its area of effect; with up to 3 charges on the ability, Sniper can completely close off any viable routes for his opponents to approach or escape. Headshot supplements Sniper's right-click damage and briefly stops enemies when it procs, which can be quite debilitating since it has a high rate of occurring. His third ability, Take Aim, gives him the largest attack range of any hero in the game, allowing him to deal high DPS from a safe distance while also giving him the ease to switch between targets at a moment's notice. Finally, Assassinate is a strong finishing and harassing ability, dealing hefty damage to an enemy from an enormous distance after a brief aiming period. Sniper is heavily item-dependent, relying on means to increase his survivability as well as his damage output as the game progresses. Skilled players will find that positioning is the most important thing to keep in mind when playing both as him or against him."}

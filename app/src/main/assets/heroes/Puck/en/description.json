Expert use of Puck's abilities together with items such as Blink Dagger will let you appear out of nowhere, suddenly leave your enemies confused, crippled and disadvantaged, and get away in the blink of an eye \u2013 but mess up your timing or misjudge the situation, and there is little left to save this fragile Hero from death.",

So while it is technically true that Puck is juvenile, it will continue to be so when the cities of the present age have sloughed away into dust. Its motives are therefore inscrutable, and what appears to be play may in fact indicate a darker purpose or just its endless fondness for mischief.",

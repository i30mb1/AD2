This passive cast has a 8 second recharge time. These passive casts do not use cast time, do not interrupt Mirana in any way and do not cost mana or put the spell on cooldown. The passive cast only applies the initial wave (dealing the same damage as an active cast), and does not hit the closest enemy unit with a secondary meteor. When no enemies are within range or visible, the effect waits until an enemy is in range or is visible. Checks for valid targets in 1 second intervals. The time is adapted to the in-game clock, meaning it only happens on full seconds. Mirana receives the thinker modifier as soon as Starstorm is learned, but it does nothing until Scepter is acquired. Does not trigger while Mirana is invisible. It can trigger during fade times or fade delays, without breaking the invisibility. Just like a charge-based ability, the counter only starts counting once the effect procs. It has a charge limit of 1.

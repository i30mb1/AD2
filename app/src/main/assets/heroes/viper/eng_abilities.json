To that end Viper wields magic-based abilities focused on inhibiting speed and defenses. He infects his quarry with Poison Attack, a seemingly innocuous liquid that rapidly burns away more health as they became sicker, while drowning them in noxious pools which block their innate powers. Meanwhile Corrosive Skin fortifies him against magic damage and poisons those who dare strike him. For impervious foes he reserves his most powerful venom, Viper Strike, as a surprise gift. A slow tank that dominates the early stages of a game, Viper depends on consolidating that advantage before opponents can afford to exploit his weaknesses."}

Battery Assault allows Clockwerk to inflict repeated damage ticks and mini-stuns on nearby enemies, allowing him to constantly hinder any enemies he manages to get close to and single out. He can also disrupt enemy movement and pen in foes with his Power Cogs, which induces an electric shock to foes outside, stunning them while damaging them and burning their mana, and can render enemies caught inside helpless. His damage nuke, Rocket Flare, gives him global nuking power that also provides scouting vision for him and his team. Finally, his ultimate, Hookshot, allows Rattletrap to instantaneously latch onto and stun a foe from long range, making him a very strong ganker. Few can escape Clockwerk once he has his sights locked in, and his machinations make him a powerful ally to have on any team."}

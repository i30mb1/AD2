The same applies upon returning. Upon returning, their speed periodically adapts based on their distance to Beastmaster and the remaining travel time. This means the axes fly a maximum of up to two seconds, up to one seconds towards the point and up to one second back.","The axe spread up to 450 distance away from each other before moving back together while traveling towards the targeted point.","The axes' minimum travel distance is 450 as well, so when targeting a point closer than 450 range, they still intersect 450 range away.","Both axes fly in arcs, so that the axe coming from Beastmaster's left hand travels back towards his right hand, and vice versa.","Uses one debuff on hit targets for all stacks. The debuff has a number on it, showing the amount of stacks.","Successive hits on the same unit fully refresh the whole stack's duration.","The axes first apply the debuff, then the damage. This means they effectively amplify their own damage as well. Since the axes work separate, one of the axes always benefits from 2 stacks of the debuff, if both hit.","A unit can only get hit once by each axe, so the maximum possible damage (before reductions and amplifications) is 60\/120\/180\/240 ( 210\/270\/330\/390).","The damage amplification only works for Beastmaster and all his units.

His mother died in childbirth; his father, a farrier for the Last King of Slom, was trampled to death when Karroch was five. Afterward Karroch was indentured to the king\u2019s menagerie, where he grew up among all the beasts of the royal court: lions, apes, fell-deer, and things less known, things barely believed in. When the lad was seven, an explorer brought in a beast like none before seen. Dragged before the King in chains, the beast spoke, though its mouth moved not. Its words: a plea for freedom. The King only laughed and ordered the beast perform for his amusement; and when it refused, struck it with the Mad Scepter and ordered it dragged to the stocks. Over the coming months, the boy Karroch sneaked food and medicinal draughts to the wounded creature, but only managed to slow its deterioration. Wordlessly, the beast spoke to the boy, and over time their bond strengthened until the boy found he could hold up his end of a conversation\u2014could in fact speak now to all the creatures of the King's menagerie. On the night the beast died, a rage came over the boy. He incited the animals of the court to rebel and threw open their cages to set them amok on the palace grounds. The Last King was mauled in the mayhem. In the chaos, one regal stag bowed to the boy who had freed him; and with Beastmaster astride him, leapt the high walls of the estate, and escaped. Now a man, Karroch the Beastmaster has not lost his ability to converse with wild creatures.

His Wild Axes allows him to lane and farm quite effectively throughout the game, even when pressured. He is able to summon a hawk and boar to aid him, each providing a good amount of utility to his team. Hawks provide free flying vision around the map, scouting his enemies while his Boars can harass and slow his enemies to a crawl while aiding him in combat. His Inner Beast aura makes his team a force to be reckoned with, providing a hefty boost to attack speed to himself, his summons, and all nearby allies. Finally, his ultimate, Primal Roar, is the longest lasting single-target reliable stun in the game and also penetrates spell immunity (being only counterable by Linken's Sphere), providing a strong initiation for his team to claim a kill. With these skills, he can push enemy towers quickly and safely, take down undefended targets with the help of Necronomicon summons, lock down a single target, and also kite enemies in teamfights. With careful observation of the battlefield, Beastmaster takes down enemies one by one and paves the way to victory."}

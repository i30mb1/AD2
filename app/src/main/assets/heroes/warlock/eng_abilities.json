This means physical damage is spread as physical damage, magical damage as magical and pure damage as pure. Because of that, the shared damage does interact with every on-damage effect like disabling Blink Dagger. This also means it is fully affected by damage manipulation, like Warlock's spell damage amplification.","Fatal Bonds' damage has the no-reflection flag, preventing its damage from interacting with other sources of damage with the same flag.","Spreads the damage before it is reduced or amplified in any way on the receiving target. When, for example, Abaddon gets damaged while under the effect of Borrowed Time, the bonds still spread the damage, before Borrowed Time turns it into heals. This also goes for illusions. When damaging a bonded illusion, the damage is spread before it gets amplified for the illusions. This also goes for finishing blows. When, for example, a unit at 10 health is hit by e.g. 1000 damage, the bonds still spread based on the 1000 damage.","Only spreads the 3 damage types.

No cursed temple was so foreboding, no cavern path so treacherous, that any concern for his own survival could dissuade him from entering if rumors hinted that some pamphlet of primordial lore might still survive in its depths. However, so often did his investigations trigger the wrath of protector entities, that he finally found it necessary to master the arts of magic. He bent himself to learning sorcery with the same thorough obsessiveness that marked his quest for incunabula, becoming the most powerful Warlock of the Academy in less time than most practitioners required to complete a course of undergraduate work. Almost as an afterthought, he carved a staff of Dreadwood and summoned into it a captive spirit from the Outer Hells. And anticipating the day when he will have recovered every last lost spellbook, he has commenced writing his own Black Grimoire. It will undoubtedly be instructive.","trivia":["In DotA, Warlock's ultimate is named Rain of Chaos and the summoned unit was called an Infernal, a hulking golem with green-colored flames.

Shadow Word is a highly versatile spell, as it allows him to support allies by healing them or harass enemies by dealing damage over time, giving him strong lane presence. Beyond the early game, Warlock can turn any teamfight in his team's favor as his other spells are strong when unleashed against multiple enemies. Fatal Bonds causes all enemies linked together to take bonus damage when one of their number takes damage, magnifying the strength of area-of-effect spells, while Upheaval can allow him to greatly slow any enemies caught in the radius of the spell, making it harder for them to maneuver in fights or escape. His ultimate, Chaotic Offering, summons a Golem after stunning all enemies in a wide area, allowing him to throw them into disarray. While unassuming and weak by himself, Warlock is a dangerous threat in any teamfight as his spells allow him to turn the enemies' numbers against them and sow chaos amongst their ranks."}

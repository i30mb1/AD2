  "description": "Chaos Knight is a melee strength hero with one of the highest physical damage output ceilings of all heroes. He is mostly played as a carry and ganker. As his name implies, he has a theme based on randomness and uncertainty. His regular attack has an incredibly wide thirty damage spread, making his last hitting ability somewhat unreliable. Chaos Bolt is his most notorious luck-based ability which, at max level, can stun a target anywhere between a mediocre 2 seconds to an effective 4 seconds that will almost certainly assure the target's death; it will also deal a variable amount of damage ranging from minuscule to moderate. Reality Rift pulls Chaos Knight and his target to a predetermined point along the line between the two and reduces the foe's armor. Chaos Strike is a crit-based ability with a proc chance and has random damage values. The four illusions produced by his ultimate Phantasm, that can deal up to his full attack damage at max level, benefit from his Chaos Strike and can teleport alongside him to attack the target whenever he uses Reality Rift. This allows Chaos Knight's physical damage output to be multiplied by up to four during teamfights later in the game, and it is not uncommon to see enemy heroes being killed instantly after being Reality Rifted by the apocalyptic horsemen. Thus, Chaos Knight is played as a carry who excels in both the mid and late game, if the game drags on long enough and he is able to acquire enough strength-based and survivability items to ensure that his illusions can stay alive, he will be able to overpower most hard carries and potentially wipe out an entire team by himself.",
  "history": "The veteran of countless battles on a thousand worlds, Chaos Knight hails from a far upstream plane where the fundamental laws of the universe have found sentient expression. Of all the ancient Fundamentals, he is the oldest and most tireless, endlessly searching out a being he knows only as \"The Light.\" Long ago the Light ventured out from the progenitor realm, in defiance of the first covenant. Now Chaos Knight shifts from plane to plane, always on the hunt to extinguish the Light wherever he finds it. A thousand times he has snuffed out the source, and always he slides into another plane to continue his search anew. Upon his steed Armageddon he rides, wading into battle with maniacal frenzy, drawing strength from the disorder of the universe. A physical manifestation of chaos itself, in times of need he calls upon other versions of himself from other planes, and together these dark horsemen ride into battle, as unstoppable as any force of nature. Only when the last Light of the world is scoured from existence will the search be ended. Where rides the Chaos Knight, death soon follows.",

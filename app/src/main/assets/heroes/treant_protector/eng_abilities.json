This has only informative purposes. This means it is not affected by the cooldown reductions of Octarine Core, Arcane Rune and the level 10 talent. However, it is affected by cooldown resets like Refresher Orb, but doing so does not affect the fade delay in any way. Time Dilation and Chakra Magic affect the cooldown visually, but do not affect the fade delay either. The cooldown starts over whenever Treant Protector attacks, to indicate that the fade delay has reset due to the attack.","Treant Protector stays invisible as long as there are trees within 265 radius around him. A status buff appears on Treant Protector whenever he is near a tree, and immediately disappears as soon as no tree is found.","The invisibility is not instantly lost upon getting too far from trees. There is a 0.75-second-long grace time. This means Treant Protector can stay up to 0.75 seconds long away from trees and still be invisible. The grace time resets whenever a tree is within range again. The grace time is not indicated anywhere.","Treant protector is phased while invisible, and can also walk through trees.","While invisible, Treant Protector's next attack has True Strike, and roots and disarms the target, preventing it from moving, attacking, and casting certain mobility spells.

It is said that the things that grow here, grow strangely. To the forces of nature this is a sacred place, made to stay hidden and unknown. Many are the traps and dangers of this land--all-consuming grasses and crossbred fauna and poisonous flowers--but none are so fierce as the mighty Treant Protectors. These ageless, titanic beings, charged with keeping the peace in this dangerous land, ensure that none within encroach without reason, and none without poach their secrets. For time untold they tended to their holy ground, uninterrupted, only dimly aware of the changing world beyond. Yet inevitably the wider world grew aware of this untamed land, and with each passing winter the outsiders grew bolder. Soon they arrived with tools to cut and with flames to burn, and often the Treants would ponder: who are these fragile, industrious creatures? What now had become of the wild, green world? There came and went an age of questions and of doubts, a thousand summers of long traditions set to scrutiny, while more and more the outsiders died and fed their earth. When all that bloomed had finally finished their stay, curiosity had overcome caution. It was decided: a lone Protector would be sent into the wider world, and instructed to wander until the glaciers arose once more, to observe the changing land and its creatures, and to discover what unknown dangers could threaten their sacred ground.","talentsTips":["The tree respawn talent sets the respawn time of all trees on the map to 2 seconds.

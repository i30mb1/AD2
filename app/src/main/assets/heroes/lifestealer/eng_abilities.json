He shared his cell with a gibbering creature known as N'aix, a thief cursed by the Vile Council with longevity, so that its life-sentence for theft and cozening might be as punishing as possible. Over the years, its chains had corroded, along with its sanity; N'aix retained no memory of its former life and no longer dreamt of escape. Seeing a perfect vessel for his plans, the wizard wove a spell of Infestation and cast his life-force into N'aix's body, intending to compel N'aix to sacrifice itself in a frenzy of violence while the mage returned to his body and crept away unnoticed. Instead, the wizard found his mind caught in a vortex of madness so powerful that it swept away his plans and shattered his will. Jarred to consciousness by the sudden infusion of fresh life, N'aix woke from its nightmare of madness and obeyed the disembodied voice that filled its skull, which had only the one thought: To escape. In that moment Lifestealer was born. The creature cast its mind into dungeon guards and soldiers, compelling them to open locks and cut down their companions, opening an unobstructed path to freedom while feeding on their lives. Lifestealer still wears the broken shackles as a warning that none may hold him, but on the inside remains a prisoner. Two minds inhabit the single form--a nameless creature of malevolent cunning, and the Master whose voice he pretends to obey.","talentsTips":["The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage.","This attack damage talent is added as raw attack damage, so it does not benefit illusions, and is not affected by most percentage-based damage increasing or reducing effects.","The evasion talent stacks multiplicatively with other sources of evasion."],"trivia":["Lifestealer's fun\/alternate name in DotA was Gollum, a significant character in the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit book series.

Once being a Hobbit, his soul got corrupted by the ring, turning into the Gollum he is now. Both Lifestealer and Gollum sometimes speak from themselves in plural form (\"we\", instead of \"I\"). They also talk to or about a \"master\". His rivalry line towards Tidehunter \"Tidehunter\u2026I love a bit of raw fish now and again.\" refers to Gollum's hate towards stewing - or the preparing in general - of fish.

Knockback distance is relative to how close they are to you.","effects":["Ability Target Point","Affects Enemies"],"notes":["The wave travels at a speed of 2000, reaching max distance in 0.45 seconds.","Reaches up to 1150 range away (travel distance + effect radius).","The knockback distance is based on the distance between Drow Ranger and the hit enemy. The closer they are, the further they get knocked back. The knockback is strongest when the distance between Drow Ranger and the enemy is 1 range, pushing the enemy 350 range away. Each additional range of distance between them affects the knockback's distance, reducing it by 0.39. However, the knockback values are truncated, so that the knockback distance decreases by 1 for every 2\u20133 range between Drow and the enemy. Due to this, the minimum knockback distance is 1 range. When standing at the exact same location as Drow Ranger, no knockback occurs, since the formula then multiplies by 0, which results in 0 knockback.","Since the knockback distances are the same on each level, and the knockback duration increases per level, the knockback speed gets lower on each level. Therefore, the maximum knockback speed is 583.33\/500\/437.5\/388.89, while the minimum speed is 1.67\/1.43\/1.25\/1.11.","Can push units over impassable terrain.

The damage is dealt in one instance together with the attack damage, and counts as attack damage as well.","When proccing against other units, they get instantly killed instead. Cannot proc against wards or buildings.","Visually alters Drow Ranger's attack projectile when proccing. Does not have priority over Desolator's or Eye of Skadi's effects.","Proccing attacks have True Strike.","The Aghanim's Scepter upgrade requires Marksmanship to be learned and causes Drow Ranger to perform instant attacks on 2 random enemies around the primary target. This means the splinters are regular attacks, using Drow Ranger's 1250 projectile speed and being disjointable. It also means that they can proc any attack modifier or any on-hit effect like a regular attack. The splinters are only released if the primary attack successfully hits a target. This means missed or disjointed attacks do not release any splinters. If Drow Ranger is blinded, the splinters can miss, unless she has True Strike. They can also miss to evasion. The splinters originate from the primary target's location, not Drow Ranger's location. Since the splinters are independent attacks, their damage does not depend on how much damage the primary target took. The damage penalty only applies to the attack damage and any bonuses. Damage dealt in separate instances is unaffected (e.g. Maelstrom and Mjollnir). Attacks do not splinter to or from invisible, invulnerable, or hidden units. Attacks do not splinter to couriers, buildings, wards, or units in the Fog of War, but can splinter off of them to nearby valid targets. Splinter attacks are not disabled by being within 400 range of an enemy hero. Splinter attacks fully benefit from Marksmanship (when it procs), but splinter attacks never use the Marksmanship attack projectile visual.","While Frost Arrows are set to auto-cast, splintered attacks will attempt to activate Frost Arrows on successful splinter hits. The auto-cast check is performed when the splintered arrows successfully hit their targets. The splintered Frost Arrows still require mana to cast, and will not be applied if Drow does not have sufficient mana. Missed or disjointed splintered attacks will not attempt to apply Frost Arrows, thus spending no mana, and applying no slow. Splintered attacks will still try to apply Frost Arrows to Spell Immune units despite it not affecting them, effectively wasting mana."],"mana":"0","elements":["Partially usable by illusions.","Can be disjointed.","Partially disabled by Break.","Pierces spell immunity."],"cooldown":"0","name":"Marksmanship","description":["Enemy Hero Search Radius: 400","Proc Chance: 20%\/30%\/40%","Proc Damage: 120\/130\/140","Splinter Search Radius: 0 ( 375)","Max Splinter Targets: 0 ( 2)","Splinter Damage Reduction: 0 ( 50%)"],"hot_key":"R","legacy_key":"P"}],"bio":"Drow Ranger's given name is Traxex--a name well suited to the short, trollish, rather repulsive Drow people. But Traxex herself is not a Drow. Her parents were travelers in a caravan set upon by bandits, whose noisy slaughter of innocents roused the ire of the quiet Drow people. After the battle settled, the Drow discovered a small girl-child hiding in the ruined wagons, and agreed she could not be abandoned. Even as child, Traxex showed herself naturally adept at the arts they prized: Stealth, silence, subtlety. In spirit, if not in physique, she might have been a Drow changeling, returned to her proper home. But as she grew, she towered above her family and came to think of herself as ugly. After all, her features were smooth and symmetrical, entirely devoid of warts and coarse whiskers. Estranged from her adopted tribe, she withdrew to live alone in the woods. Lost travelers who find their way from the forest sometimes speak of an impossibly beautiful Ranger who peered at them from deep among the trees, then vanished like a dream before they could approach. Lithe and stealthy, icy hot, she moves like mist in silence.

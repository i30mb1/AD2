Mortals who hear his voice hear their darkest secrets whispered in their ear. He calls to the hidden fear in every Hero's heart.

Mostly played as a support, his high starting stats make him a menace in lane. Bane possesses four potent single-target spells, which must be used well to make up for his lack of pushing power or area of effect presence. Enfeeble reduces the target's status resistance and attack speed. Brain Sap deals hefty pure damage to the target and heals Atropos for the same amount. Nightmare puts a unit to sleep, completely disabling it for several seconds. The unit awakes when it is attacked or takes damage, though Bane can freely attack nightmared targets without waking them. Finally, Bane's Fiend's Grip is a channeled spell that completely disables the target, drains its mana and deals high damage over time. Bane's aptitude for incapacitating and debilitating enemies make him an invaluable support to allies\u2014and a nightmare for enemies."}

Procs Echo Sabre on all hit targets without putting the item on cooldown.

While in the air, other units can pass below him.","During Rolling Thunder, Shield Crash only moves on the z axis (vertical movement), and does not move him on the x and y axis (horizontal). However, due to how vertical and horizontal movement stack with each other, it does not interfere with spells which move Pangolier on the x and y axis. This means when cast during Rolling Thunder, he effectively jumps in an arc, using the height of the jump and the velocity of Rolling Thunder.","During the short jump, Pangolier is stunned, and therefore unable to act. However, he is not disabled when jumping during Rolling Thunder.","When Rolling Thunder expires during the jump of Shield Crash, its duration gets expanded based on how long the jump takes, so that the velocity is kept until landing. However, when Rolling Thunder is ended manually during the jump, via its sub-spell, the velocity is lost, so that Pangolier falls straight down.","The actual length of the jump depends on the terrain. This means jumping onto a higher\/lower ground results in a shorter\/longer jump. This does not affect the jump distance.","The area damage hits all enemies within range, but the buff only counts hit heroes.","Does not count illusions for the buff, but does count clones.

With one or two enemies hit, the 5 shields are small and have no extra effects. With three enemies hit, the shields are bigger and gain a light yellow flame-like effect. With four or more enemies hit, the yellow flame gets much stronger.","When recast while still having the buff from a previous cast, it refreshes, and the damage resistance updates if more enemy heroes were hit, but not if less were hit.","If Pangolier is stunned mid jump, he will not apply the damage or gain the damage resistance buff upon landing, but the skill will still go on cooldown","The cast backswing increases to 0.54 during Rolling Thunder.","When upgraded, the Swashbuckle is applied instantly upon cast, not upon landing.

In order to get a better view he activates Firefly, leaving a burning trail of liquid fire that scorches those who dare cross his path. Now able to cross through previously impassable terrain Batrider has free reign to decide how to continue his reign of terror. If he's feeling generous he'll hurl an explosive clocktail as a parting shot. More often, he seizes victims with Flaming Lasso and drags them back through his burning trail to the clutches of merciless allies. Used properly, Batrider is a fearsome hero constantly risking his own safety to incite fiery chaos and destruction.",

They say the Rider was just a lad cutting chaff in his family's field when he was taken, swept up by a massive morde-bat looking for take-out. But this boy had a better idea, and wriggled his way from his captor's grip, onto the beast's back, and hacked it down with his tools. Emerging from the bloody wreckage and intoxicated by the thrill of flight, the boy realized he'd found his calling. The boy grew, and every summer he'd return to his family's field, often setting out into the bush seeking to reclaim that first thrill of facing death in the form of jaws or a fatal fall. The years went on, but his fire only grew stronger. He studied the overgrowth, plunging deeper with each expedition, until finally he found his way to the caves at the heart of hostility. They say the Rider, on the eve of a scorching summer night, had nothing but a rope, a bottle of liquid courage and a burning determination to feel the skies once more, when he plunged inside\u2026",

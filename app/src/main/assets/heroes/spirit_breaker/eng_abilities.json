A unit may only be bashed once per cast. so if an enemy enters the area a second time, they do not get bashed again.

This means it still continues when the target turns invisible.","Does not provide vision when targeting neutral creeps.","Destroys trees within a small radius around Spirit Breaker whenever the charge ends.","The Special Attack buff is placed upon reaching the target and lasts for 0.1 seconds.

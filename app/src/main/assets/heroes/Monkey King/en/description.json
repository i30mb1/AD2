        "The formation they take is always the same except when space is limited by the edges of the map. The first ring soldiers form a pentagon within a 300 radius circle, with the tip always facing north. The second ring soldiers form a nonagon within a 750 radius circle, with the tip always facing north as well. The third ring soldiers form a heptagon within a 1100 radius circle, with the tip always facing north as well.",

They are unselectable (by both Monkey King and enemies), uncontrollable, and can neither pick up, nor drop any items.

Their base stats adapt on every resummon (e.g. permanent stats loss from Glaives of Wisdom or Essence Shift). While the clones are affected by attack speed buffs and slow, they may only attack once every 1.2 seconds, even if their attack misses. Their day and night vision is reduced to 600.

Soldiers do not spawn while Monkey King is affected by the Tree Dance bounce leap and bounce perch modifiers, during Mischief, while fully invisible, during certain abilities that cause him to be hidden, or while dead. Unlike soldiers from a regular cast, passively spawned soldiers can attack any unit except Roshan, but require Monkey King to be within 500 range of them to attack buildings. Acquiring the item instantly starts with a charge, so that a soldier spawns instantly. When Monkey King dies, the soldiers immediately disappear.",

  "description": "Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, is a melee agility hero, best known for his slippery nature and his ability to do Mischief, deceiving his enemies by turning into trees and other objects. Armed with his magic extending staff, the Monkey King slams the ground with Boundless Strikes, and leaps to the treetops to have advantage over his foes with Tree Dance. Perched on a tree, he gains a clear view of his surroundings, allowing him to jump down on unsuspecting targets, dealing heavy damage and slowing their escape with Primal Spring. As a carry, the Monkey King is granted extra damage and lifesteal from Jingu Mastery after landing consecutive attacks on his opponents. In a teamfight, at Wukong's Command an army of clones is sent out across the battlefield to fight for him, while he himself has his armor increased. Together with the help of his clones and his team, the Monkey King is a force to be reckoned with.",
  "history": "For 500 years the mountain pressed down upon him, only his head free from the crushing weight of the stonewrought prison the elder gods had summoned to halt his childish rebellion. Moss grew along the lines of his exposed face, tufts of grass sprouted from his ears; his vision was framed in wildflowers reaching from the soil around his cheeks. Most thought him long dead, tormented by the gods for waging war against the heavens until naught but his legend survived. But, as the stories go, the Monkey King cannot die. So he waited. Until the gods came to offer a chance at absolution, he endured. And when they did come to name the price, Sun Wukong accepted their charge: he would accompany a young acolyte on a secret pilgrimage, protect him from demons and dangers of the road, and guide the man home in possession of a coveted relic. Do that, and humbly obey the human's commands in service to their holy mission, and Wukong would prove himself reformed. For a change, Sun Wukong fulfilled his oath to the gods with honor, and atoned for the sins of past insurrections. The acolyte, much learned in hardships, was returned to his home temple, relic in hand; and Wukong-finding himself for the first time in proper standing with any gods of consequence-was content for a short while to give up his old thirst for adventure and glory. But the Monkey King was born for mischief...and offending the gods never gets old.",

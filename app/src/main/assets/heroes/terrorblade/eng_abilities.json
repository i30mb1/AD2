  "bio": "Terrorblade is the demon marauder--an outlaw hellion whom even other demons fear. A cosmic iconoclast, he stole from the Demon Lords, ignored the codified rites that should have bound his behavior, and broke every law of the seven Infernal Regions. For his crimes, he was taught this lesson: even Hell has a hell. A short, brutal trial ensued, with many dead on all sides, and he was finally incarcerated in Foulfell, a hidden dimension where demonkind imprison their own. But Foulfell is no normal prison. In this dark mirror of reality, demons are sentenced to gaze eternally into the twisted reflection of their own souls. But instead of suffering, Terrorblade made himself master of his own reflected worst self--a raging, thieving demon of unimaginable power. With his inner beast under sway, he destroyed the fractal prison walls and burst free to turn his terror loose upon all creation.",

    "Terrorblade's title in DotA was Soul Keeper. Unlike other name changes, this one does not appear to be related to copyright issues with Blizzard. A possible reason could be that the title \"Soul Keeper\" doesn't fit him anymore, since only one ability could be associated with souls.",
    "In-game, Terrorblade constantly leaves flaming footprints wherever he goes, similar to his DotA hero model, Illidan Stormrage (a prominent Warcraft character). These can be seen by enemies, but stop being rendered once he's out of their vision, meaning that one cannot track down an enemy Terrorblade that goes invisible or enters the Fog of War on the basis of his footprints.",
    "Terrorblades response when dying \"I go where angels fear to tread.\" is a reference to the line \"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread\" from Alexander Pope's poem An Essay on Criticism. Zeus also has a response that references this poem."

  "desc": "Terrorblade the Demon Marauder is a melee agility hero who grows to a devastating carry in the later stages of the game. Terrorblade has the highest starting armor in the game, but is squishy due to his low health, meaning he needs strength items to be tanky enough to sustain damage to himself and his illusions. As with all illusion-based heroes, he needs attribute-based items in order to make his illusions powerful. He uses Reflection, which creates invulnerable illusions of all nearby enemy heroes for a few seconds. Conjure Image creates an illusion of Terrorblade that deals considerable damage at max level. Terrorblade can create up to two illusions, which together deal more damage than Terrorblade himself, effectively multiplying Terrorblade's base damage (but not his bonus damage). Metamorphosis transforms Terrorblade into a powerful ranged demon capable of wreaking havoc on his enemies with its bonus range and damage, but makes Terrorblade slower. Metamorphosis also makes illusions of Terrorblade transform into his demonic form, but they revert back once they wander too far away from Terrorblade. Finally his ultimate, Sunder, swaps his health with a targeted hero, ally or enemy alike. This ability makes ganks on him incredibly risky since he can sunder a hero before finishing them off with a few attacks. With his two illusion-based abilities, the 'semi-ultimate' Metamorphosis and his ultimate, Sunder, Terrorblade's skill set makes him a strong foe in the early game and absolutely terrifying at the later stages of the game. He is usually played as a hard carry."

Using an ancient form of animal enthrallment, Chen\u2019s people husbanded the hardy desert locuthi, a stunted species of burrowing dragon that melted desert sands into tubes of glass where twice-a-year rains collected. Always on the edge of starvation and thirst, fighting amongst their neighbors and each other, Chen\u2019s clan made the mistake, one fateful day, of ambushing the wrong caravan. In the vicious battle that followed, Chen\u2019s clan was outmatched. The armored Knights of the Fold made short work of the enthralled locuthi, who attacked and died in waves. With their dragons dead, the tribesmen followed. Chen struggled, and slashed, and clawed, and perished\u2014or would have. Defeated, on his knees, he faced his execution with humility, offering his neck to the blade. Moved by Chen\u2019s obvious courage, the executioner halted his sword. Instead of the blade, Chen was given a choice: death or conversion. Chen took to the faith with a ferocity. He joined the Fold and earned his armor one bloody conversion at a time. Now, with the fanaticism of a convert, and with his powers of animal enthrallment at their peak, he seeks out unbelievers and introduces them to their final reward.","talentsTips":["Gold granted from the talent is unreliable gold."],"trivia":["Chen's fun names in DotA were Chechen and Jackie Chen, a pun on the name of the famed actor Jackie Chan.","Chen's death quote \"My Leg\" refers to a Spongebob Squarepants running gag."],"talents":["+350 Hand of God Heal:+5 Holy Persuasion Max Units","+1000 Holy Persuasion Minimum Health:+180 Gold\/Min","+20 Holy Persuasion Damage:-30s Divine Favor Cooldown","+200 Cast Range:+30% XP Gain"],"desc":"Chen the Holy Knight is a ranged intelligence hero, whose signature ability, Holy Persuasion, allows him to take control of creeps.

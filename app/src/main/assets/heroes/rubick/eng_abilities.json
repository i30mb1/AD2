The 3 Shadowrazes or the two Whirling Axes are not sub-spells. This also goes for spells provided by an Aghanim's Scepter (e.g. Eyes In The Forest, Unrefined Fireblast and Nimbus). Rubick's Aghanim's Scepter causes the stolen spell to be upgraded. Since the above-mentioned spells are not upgrades to existing spells, but rather just extra spells granted to the hero, they are treated as their own spells by Spell Steal. This means, for example, Rubick with an Aghanim's Scepter will not get both Fireblasts by stealing one of them, but he can steal Unrefined Fireblast by itself without having the Scepter.","The cooldown of all stolen spells is saved.

Yet as with any sorcerer\u2019s circle, a sense of community has never guaranteed competitive courtesy. Already a renowned duelist and scholar of the grander world of sorcery, it had never occurred to Rubick that he might perhaps be Magus material until he was in the midst of his seventh assassination attempt. As he casually tossed the twelfth of a string of would-be killers from a high balcony, it dawned on him how utterly unimaginative the attempts on his life had become. Where once the interruption of a fingersnap or firehand might have put a cheerful spring in his step, it had all become so very predictable. He craved greater competition. Therefore, donning his combat mask, he did what any wizard seeking to ascend the ranks would do: he announced his intention to kill a Magus. Rubick quickly discovered that to threaten one Magus is to threaten them all, and they fell upon him in force. Each antagonist's spell was an unstoppable torrent of energy, and every attack a calculated killing blow. But very soon something occurred that Rubick's foes found unexpected: their arts appeared to turn against them. Inside the magic maelstrom, Rubick chuckled, subtly reading and replicating the powers of one in order to cast it against another, sowing chaos among those who had allied against him. Accusations of betrayal began to fly, and soon the sorcerers turned one upon another without suspecting who was behind their undoing. When the battle finally drew to a close, all were singed and frozen, soaked and cut and pierced. More than one lay dead by an ally\u2019s craft. Rubick stood apart, sore but delighted in the week\u2019s festivities. None had the strength to argue when he presented his petition of assumption to the Hidden Council, and the Insubstantial Eleven agreed as one to grant him the title of Grand Magus.","talentsTips":["The cast range talent does not affect the jump distance of Fade Bolt.","This attack damage talent is added as raw attack damage, so it does not benefit illusions, and is not affected by most percentage-based damage increasing or reducing effects.","The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage."],"trivia":["In both DotA and Dota 2, he is the son of Aghanim. He also possesses an imitation of Aghanim's scepter as one of his cosmetic items.","Upon using Walrus PUNCH!, he would launch a projectile of himself, spinning and with head ahead, towards the target. When his target was Tusk, the overhead text on the target read \"Sucker Punch!\" in green colors. The text read \"Stolen Punch! on other targets.","Rubick is named after Ernő Rubik, the Hungarian inventor who designed the \"Magic Cube\" (now more commonly called as the \"Rubik's Cube\"), a popular combination puzzle. His response, \"Now, where's my cube?\", and his cosmetic item, Staff of Perplex, are also references to the Rubik's Cube.","In DotA, Rubick couldn't steal several spells due to several reasons: Transformation spells caused various issues, so they all could not be stolen. The following abilities are transformation spells and thus unstealable in DotA: Chemical Rage, God's Strength, Elder Dragon Form, Shapeshift, Flesh Golem, Flak Cannon, True Form, Berserker's Rage, Split Shot, Metamorphosis, Spirit Form, Firefly and Arctic Burn Besides transformation spells, several other spells could also not be stolen due to either engine errors or other coding conflicts: Morph, Summon Spirit Bear, Spin Web, Soul Assumption, Refraction, Borrowed Time, Overcharge, Spirits, Insatiable Hunger, Devour, Fire Remnant, Activate Fire Remnant, Rolling Boulder and Tempest Double Since DotA only uses legacy hotkeys, he could not steal any spell which uses the hotkey X, Z and Q. The following abilities could not be stolen due to hotkey conflicts: Abilities with hotkey X: X Marks the Spot, Shadowraze (Medium), Tornado, Exorcism Abilities with hotkey Z: Shadowraze (Near), Alacrity Abilities with hotkey Q: None","Due to Rubick's nature of using spells of other heroes, he has many custom animations for a lot of spells.

Although he is mostly played as a support and is extremely fragile the entire length of the game, he can still prove to be one of the most influential heroes if he utilizes good positioning and well-timed usage of his ultimate, Spell Steal. Spell Steal allows Rubick to cast an enemy hero's most recently used spell, giving him supreme versatility throughout the game. By stealing the right abilities, the Grand Magus can aid himself and allies by casting crippling disables, applying curses, unleashing powerful nukes, disorienting the enemy team, supporting his allies with buffs, escaping from rough situations, or even enhancing his own physical attacks. His other abilities are just as worthy of a Magus: Telekinesis lets Rubick magically lift an enemy into the air, rendering the target helpless and vulnerable, before hurling the lifted enemy to the ground up to a short distance away and stunning nearby foes on impact. Fade Bolt blasts enemies with a stream of arcane energy which bounces to all enemies nearby, dealing damage and reducing their attack damage. Arcane Supremacy is a passive ability, which amplifies the spell damage and debuffs of Rubick's spells, both his and the ones he's stolen. Rubick's versatile ability-set and his infamous Spell Steal make him a flexible and powerful hero that can work in any lineup although he does suffer from long cooldowns and the surfacing predictability of his ultimate."}

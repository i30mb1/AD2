His Charge of Darkness lets him charge rapidly towards any enemy visible on the map, while knocking off all enemies in his path. If you see the charge coming, it may already be too late. Bulldoze provides him with bonus movement speed and status resistance in order to easily chase his opponents while reducing the duration of most disables. He is picked mostly for his high damage given by his Greater Bash which crushes the life out of his helpless victims (and stuns them). Barathrum can instantly and quickly move to his enemy via Nether Strike and shock them with a soul-bashing blow. Tanky, mobile and with an array of high-damage knockbacks, including a passive one attached to his right clicks, Spirit Breaker's ganking capabilities are second to none.",

To that end, he assembled a form that would serve him well, both in our world and out of it. His physical form borrows from the strengths of this world, blending features both bovine and simian--horns, hooves and hands--as outward emblems of his inner qualities of strength, speed and cunning. He wears a ring in his nose, as a reminder that he serves a hidden master, and that this world in which he works is but a shadow of the real one.",

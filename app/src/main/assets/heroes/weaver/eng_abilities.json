{"abilities":[{"spell":"Weaver launches a swarm of 12 young Weavers that latch on any enemy unit in their path, attacking and reducing armor until it is killed.","effects":["Ability Target Point","Affects Enemies","Damage Physical"],"notes":["The Swarm moves forward at a speed of 600, taking 5 seconds to reach max distance.","The beetles are not attackable when traveling as a swarm. They become attackable only after latching onto targets.","Beetles have the highest priority for auto-attack behaviors, together with Phantom's Embrace's Phantoms.","The beetles spawn within a 300 radius around of Weaver (random position) and move forward as a swarm.","When an enemy unit comes within 100 radius of a beetle, the beetle latches onto it, unless it already has a beetle latched onto it. This means that multiple casts cannot affect the same unit more than once simultaneously. The beetles can latch on invulnerable units, but not on invisible or hidden units. If a beetle's target turns hidden after latching, it still stays on it and is not removed. If a beetle's target turns invisible after latching, the beetle dies instantly (credited to no one), if the unit is not under True Sight. When the beetles get affected by Chronosphere they instantly die, credited to no one.","The beetles can latch on units 3400 range away (spawn radius + travel distance + latch radius).","When attached, the beetle always stays 64 range in front of the unit.","The beetles do not actually attack their targets, but rather the spell simply deals damage to them in the set intervals while the beetle is attached. This means the damage is sourced to Weaver, so that it is affected by spell damage amplification and spell lifesteal.","The armor reduction is independent from the damage. It keeps reducing armor on ethereal targets, but not invulnerable targets. The armor reduction is directly bound to the beetle, so it disappears always together with it.","Beetles attack in 1.25\/1.1\/0.95\/0.8 second intervals, starting immediately when latching on a unit, resulting in up to 13\/15\/17\/21 attacks.","The armor reduction is applied with the same intervals, but happens before the damage is applied.","The Swarm can deal up to 234\/300\/374\/504 damage to each latched enemy (before reductions).","Can reduce up to 13\/15\/17\/21 ( 19.5\/22.5\/25.5\/31.5) armor per unit.","The Swarm's damage can be reduced by Damage Block, but ignores evasion.","The beetles provide flying vision while traveling forwards and while attached to a unit."],"mana":"110","elements":["Does not pierce spell immunity."],"cooldown":"44\/36\/28\/20","name":"The Swarm","description":["Cast Animation: 0.3+0","Cast Range: 3000","Max Travel Distance: 3000","Beetles Spawn Radius: 300","Beetles Latch Radius: 100","Number of Beetles: 12","Hero Attacks to Destroy: 4 ( 6)","Non-Hero Attacks to Destroy: 8 ( 12)","Tick Interval: 1.25\/1.1\/0.95\/0.8","Damage per Tick: 18\/20\/22\/24","Armor Reduction per Tick: 1 ( 1.5)","Beetle Duration: 16"],"hot_key":"Q","legacy_key":"R"},{"spell":"Weaver shifts out of visibility, gaining the ability to move at maximum speed through physical units--doing harm to any enemies it passes through.","effects":["Ability No Target","Affects Self \/ Enemies","Damage Magical"],"notes":["Shukuchi does not interrupt Weaver's channeling spells upon cast.","Invisibility disjoints projectiles upon cast, if the enemy has no True Sight.","Can only damage the same unit once per cast.","Applies a haste on Weaver, meaning he cannot be slowed below the set value.","During the fade time, Weaver can cast spells, use items and perform attacks without breaking the invisibility.","Invisibility is broken upon reaching the cast point of spells or items, or upon launching an attack.","Allows Weaver to path through other units, including wards, but not through buildings.","Unlike other phasing invisibility spells, Shukuchi turns Weaver phased directly on cast, instead of after the fade time.","Weaver can pick up or drop items without breaking the invisibility.","If the level 25 talent is skilled during Shukuchi, the bonus movement speed is applied immediately."],"mana":"70","elements":["Does not pierce spell immunity."],"cooldown":"12\/10\/8\/6","name":"Shukuchi","description":["Cast Animation: 0+0","Fade Time: 0.25","Damage Radius: 175","Damage: 100\/125\/150\/175 ( 175\/200\/225\/250)","Haste Speed: 550 ( 750)","Duration: 4"],"hot_key":"W","legacy_key":"C"},{"spell":"Allows Weaver to dispatch two attacks at once.","effects":["Ability Passive","Affects Enemies","Damage Physical"],"notes":["Causes Weaver to perform an instant attack on the attacked target 0.25 seconds after the leading attack.

It is the work of the Weavers to keep the fabric tight, to repair worn spots in the mesh of reality. They also defend from the things that gnaw and lay their eggs in frayed regions, whose young can quickly devour an entire universe if the Weavers let their attention lapse. Skitskurr was a master Weaver, charged with keeping one small patch of creation tightly woven and unfaded. But the job was not enough to satisfy. It nagged him that the original work of creation all lay in the past; the Loom had done its work and travelled on. He wanted to create rather than merely maintain\u2014to weave worlds of his own devising. He began making small changes to his domain, but the thrill of creation proved addictive, and his strokes became bolder, pulling against the pattern that the Loom had woven. The guardians came, with their scissors, and Weaver's world was pared off, snipped from the cosmic tapestry, which they rewove without him in it. Skitskurr found himself alone, apart from his kind, a state that would have been torment for any other Weaver. But Skitskurr rejoiced, for now he was free. Free to create for himself, to begin anew. The raw materials he needed to weave a new reality were all around him. All he had to do was tear apart this old world at the seams.","talentsTips":["The strength talent effectively grants Weaver 280 health, 1.4 health regen and 1.12% magic resistance."],"trivia":["Weaver's original title was Nerubian Weaver, and his original name was Anub'seran.

This is mainly due to his low-cooldown Shukuchi ability, which provides him both max movement speed and invisibility when used, making him highly effective at chasing enemies as well as escaping from battle. Additionally, his ultimate, Time Lapse, is another survival tool, allowing Weaver to regain the position and health points he had precisely 5 seconds prior to activation. His exceptional ability to maneuver around the battle, seeking the most fragile enemy heroes, is bolstered by his last two abilities. The Swarm is a wave of insects projected in front of Weaver that latch onto any visible enemy they come across. Until they are killed off, they will gradually inflict damage over time, reduce enemy armor, and perhaps most importantly, provide vision to Weaver. Finally, Geminate Attack allows Weaver to passively launch an additional attack every few seconds, making his offensive all the more potent. Not a hero capable of standing on the front lines, Weaver is nonetheless a huge threat against a team that has little ability to prevent his extreme maneuverability."}

With his long-lasting abilities, Underlord is able to control wide areas of the battlefield during teamfights and skirmishes. Raining down damage from afar with Firestorm, he clears out creeps and discourages enemies from approaching. With his ultimate, Dark Rift, he can teleport his entire team across the map, taking enemies by surprise, pushing in lanes while the other team is dead or out of position. He can also use it as an escape mechanism, bringing himself and his own team to safety in a dicey situation. Enemies' base attack damage are reduced around Underlord by his Atrophy Aura, making him and his team far more durable when dealing with physical damage. The aura also provides him with damage with the death of nearby enemy creeps and heroes, making him an excellent laner and a strong pusher after a won teamfight as well. One of the best area disables in the game, Pit of Malice presents a very large obstacle for enemies, especially melee attackers. With it, Underlord can repeatedly ensnare multiple enemies at once, making him a potent and disruptive opponent in any teamfight.",

Down and down again, well beneath the slithering magma fields and simmering roots of dormant volcanoes stands the obsidian city of Aziyog, its incomparable stonework spanning an endless cavern. Within honeycomb walls mortared with the bones of countless slaves lies the domain of the Abyssal Horde, and their brutal underlord Vrogros. Armed by the monstrous forgemasters of his kind and well-practiced in the arts of the Dark Rift, Vrogros is able to conjure forth flame and crippling malice through the twist between worlds. He seeks always to expand his holdings, destroying or enslaving all he encounters. Yet the lands offered by the subterranean realm are few, and so his sights have turned upward. By his command the first waves of abyssal invaders have already marched through the rift, a few doomed legions meant merely to test the might of nations above. Now, as his full force readies itself for unending conquest, Vrogros himself steps into a sunlit world to announce his coming reign. Those who face the Underlord will bow and pay tribute, or be crushed where they stand.",

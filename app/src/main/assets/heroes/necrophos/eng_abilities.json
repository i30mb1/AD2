While others of the order went out to succor the ill, the newly ordained cardinal secluded himself within the Cathedral of Rumusque, busily scheming to acquire the property of dying nobles, promising them spiritual rewards if they signed over their terrestrial domains. As the plague receded to a few stubborn pockets, his behavior came to the attention of the greater order, which found him guilty of heresy and sentenced him to serve in the plague ward, ensorcelled with spells that would ensure him a slow and lingering illness. But they had not counted on his natural immunity. Rotund'jere caught the pox, but instead of dying, found it feeding his power, transforming him into a veritable plague-mage, a Pope of Pestilence. Proclaiming himself the Necrophos, he travels the world, spreading plague wherever he goes, and growing in terrible power with every village his pestilential presence obliterates.","talentsTips":["The strength talent effectively grants Necrophos 200 health, 1 health regen and 0.8% magic resistance.","This attack damage talent is added as raw attack damage, so it does not benefit illusions, and is not affected by most percentage-based damage increasing or reducing effects.","The magic resistance talent stacks multiplicatively with other sources of magic resistance.","The magic resistance talent increases Necrophos's magic resistance to 40%."],"trivia":["Necrophos's response, \"My name is lesion!\" probably has to do with the Bible passage Mark 5:9, that reads in the NIV, \"Then Jesus asked him, 'What is your name?'

In the November 21, 2013 Patch, Necrolyte's name was changed to Necrophos, likely to avoid copyright issues with Blizzard. As phos (φῶς) is the Greek word for light, it is a pun on the homonym of \"Necrolight\" of his former name. In the same update, extra filters were added to Necrophos' voice, along with a 10% higher pitch, to make him sound more distinct from Warlock.

His abilities are most effective in team fights where he can damage enemies and heal allies simultaneously, while picking off key enemy heroes with his ultimate. Necrophos is most dangerous when his enemy is severely injured, instantly killing them with his ultimate while recovering over time after killing his foe. Necrophos is naturally fragile, but his mechanics require him to stay in the midst of encounters; it is for this reason that he depends on items to prevent his death. Ideally, by casting Death Pulse repeatedly, he and his team are able to stay alive, while regenerating his health and mana for each life his takes, while the enemy team's health is gradually decaying by those same pulses and his Heartstopper Aura, which reduces enemy health by a small percentage each second. Because his abilities are suited to prolonged encounters, he must build items which allow him to survive for as long as possible against his enemies, as well as utilizing his Ghost Shroud to dodge physical damage and crippling the movement of his enemies, allowing his team to catch up and surround them. When the time is right, his ultimate, Reaper's Scythe, has its damage increased by how much of their maximum health the target is missing; meaning that an enemy that is close to death will be killed outright by it. Necrophos is best understood as a hero who is weak at the beginning of a fight but becomes more dangerous with each passing second."}

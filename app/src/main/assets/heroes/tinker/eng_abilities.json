As a matter of pride, they survive by their wits, and use only those powers of nature that may be unlocked through rational methodologies. Even this forbearance has led to a great deal of trouble, as Boush can attest. Once a key investigator of natural law, Boush the Tinker led a vast intellectual investigation into the workings of nature, founding a subterranean laboratory in the rumored, mist-wreathed wastes of the Violet Plateau. While scorning mages for the dangers they visit upon the world, Boush and his Tinker associates haughtily wrenched open a portal to some realm beyond comprehension and ushered in some nightmares of their own. A black mist rose from the cavernous interior of the Violet Plateau, shrouding it in permanent darkness from which sounds of horror perpetually emanate. Boush escaped with only his wits and the contraptions he carried, the sole Tinker to survive the Violet Plateau Incident.",

    "The Tinker's voice actor, Harry \"Hal\" Robins, also voiced Dr. Isaac Kleiner in Half-Life 2 and the scientists of Black Mesa in Half-Life. Many of Tinker's voice lines reference characters and events from the Half-Life universe. In addition, the name \"Violet Plateau\" is quite similar to \"Black Mesa\", and the events described in Tinker's backstory are remarkably similar to the events of Half-Life. Tinker's responses upon killing Broodmother's Spiderlings \"Lamarr, is that you?\" and \"Lamarr?!\" are a reference to Dr. Kleiner's \"debeaked\" pet headcrab, Hedy Lamarr. Many of Tinker's lines while using Rearm come directly from Half-Life 2 including \"The massless field flux should self-limit\" and \"I've clamped the manifold parameters to\u2026 CY base and LG orbifold\u2026 Hilbert inclusive\". Tinker's death line \"It's probably not a problem, probably\" is also a reference to Dr. Kleiner, who says it in the beggining of Half Life's second chapter right before the equipment he and his team are working on suffers a catastrophical malfunction and causes the alien invasion of Black Mesa. Tinker's selecting respones \"With my brains and your brawn, we'll make an excellent team\" is also a quote from Dr. Kleiner.",

  "desc": "Boush, the Tinker, is a ranged intelligence hero who leverages great mobility and blistering nukes to push lanes and gank his enemies. Tinker's ultimate Rearm resets the cooldown on his items and abilities, allowing him to deal prodigious damage with his Laser, Heat-Seeking Missiles and with items such as Dagon. By refreshing Boots of Travel, Rearm also grants Tinker vast mobility, enabling him to pressure multiple lanes with his March of the Machines. Tinker's mana costs are very high, however, so to remain a global threat he must regularly regenerate at his fountain. His mana dependency and modest stat gain make quickly acquiring Boots of travel a key to success. When played with the right items, good mana management and mechanical skill, there are few heroes Tinker will not evaporate."

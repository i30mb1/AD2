Deep below the surface of the world lay unknown wonders and horrors. Down and down again, well beneath the slithering magma fields and simmering roots of dormant volcanoes stands the obsidian city of Aziyog, its incomparable stonework spanning an endless cavern. Within honeycomb walls mortared with the bones of countless slaves lies the domain of the Abyssal Horde, and their brutal underlord Vrogros. Armed by the monstrous forgemasters of his kind and well-practiced in the arts of the Dark Rift, Vrogros is able to conjure forth flame and crippling malice through the twist between worlds. He seeks always to expand his holdings, destroying or enslaving all he encounters. Yet the lands offered by the subterranean realm are few, and so his sights have turned upward. By his command the first waves of abyssal invaders have already marched through the rift, a few doomed legions meant merely to test the might of nations above. Now, as his full force readies itself for unending conquest, Vrogros himself steps into a sunlit world to announce his coming reign. Those who face the Underlord will bow and pay tribute, or be crushed where they stand.","trivia":["Underlord is named Azgalor, the Pit Lord in DotA. His title, Pit Lord, was changed to avoid possible copyright infringements with Blizzard Entertainment, since the Pit Lords are a race of demons in the Warcraft universe. His name, Azgalor, was also changed for the same reason. Azgalor was a character from the Warcraft universe as well, who served one of the main antagonists of the Warcraft universe as a well known commander. According to the Bastion Announcer, \"Pyre Lord\" was also a proposed name for Underlord. Up until the June 23, 2016 Patch, Underlord's title was \"Abyssal Underlord\". While the rationale of dropping \"Abyssal\" is unclear, it may have been to prevent confusion with the shorthand terminology of Abyssal Blade.","Underlord had been developed since 2012; he already had a beta model, placeholder ability icons and fully finished and working abilities. He could also be spawned in lobbies with cheats enabled for a short while before it was disabled. This suggests that his release was originally planned much earlier (as a comparison, all other heroes were released shortly after their files were added to the game), but was delayed for reasons unknown.","Before his release, Underlord was showcased at the All-Star match of The International 2016, played by N0tail. He originally picked Sand King\u200B, but a bit after the start of the game, SirActionSlacks replaced his pick by Underlord.","The line Underlord says after killing Bane, \"You have my permission to die.\", is a reference to the famous line \"When Gotham is ashes, you have my permission to die\", said by the villain Bane from the movie The Dark Knight Rises.","Underlord's line when casting Dark Rift, \"Hold on to your butts!\", was spoken by Samuel L. Jackson's character Ray Arnold in the movie Jurassic Park (1993).","Underlord was the final DotA hero ported over, before Dota 2 began to feature original heroes."],"talents":["25% Firestorm Building Damage:+0.8s Pit of Malice Root","+25 Health Regen:+70 Attack Speed","+7 Atrophy Permanent Bonus Damage:+150 Cast Range","+30 Movement Speed:+18 Firestorm Wave Damage"],"desc":"Underlord 25 + 3.3 12 + 1.6 17 + 2.3 Level Base 1 15 25 Health 200 700 1620 2280 Health regen 0 2.5 7.12 10.42 Magic res. 25% 26.5% 29.27% 31.25% Mana 75 279 663 939 Mana regen 0 0.85 2.46 3.61 Spell dmg 0% 1.19% 3.44% 5.05% Armor 3 4.92 8.5 11.06 Att\/sec 0.59 0.66 0.79 0.88 Move sp amp. 0% 0.6% 1.72% 2.52% Damage 37\u201243 62\u201268 108\u2012114 141\u2012147 Movement speed 295 Attack speed 100 Turn rate 0.6 Vision range 1800\/800 Attack range 150 Projectile speed Instant Attack animation 0.45+0.7 Base attack time 1.7 Damage block 8 Collision size 24 Legs 2  Gib type Default"}

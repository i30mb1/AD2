If Earth Spirit targets an area, he will smash the nearest Stone Remnant in a 200 radius. The travelling unit or Remnant damages all enemy units it hits.

Stone Remnants travel further than other units.","effects":["Ability Target Point \/ Target Unit","Affects Enemies \/ Allies","Damage Magical"],"notes":["Boulder Smash has different targeting rules based on whether he wants to smash a distant remnant, nearby remnant or a unit.","Smashing a distant remnant: To do this, the ground must be targeted. There must be a Stone Remnant within 200 radius around the targeted point. If a remnant is found, Earth Spirit walks towards the point until the remnant is within 200 range.

Upon reaching the remnant, Earth Spirit smashes it towards the direction he approached it from.","Smashing a nearby remnant: To do this, the ground must be targeted. There must not be a Stone Remnant within 200 around the targeted point. There must be a Stone Remnant within 200 radius around Earth Spirit. Boulder Smash has a 2000 range default cast range. This range allows Earth Spirit to aim the Stone Remnant precisely. When targeting beyond 2000 range, Earth spirit walks up until the point is within range. If there is a remnant nearby, he smashes it.","Smashing a unit: To do this, the unit must be directly targeted. There must not be a remnant between Earth Spirit and the targeted unit. Earth Spirit walks up until the target is within 150 range and smashes it towards the direction he approached the target from. If Earth Spirit meets a remnant while walking up to the target, he smashes the remnant towards the targeted unit instead.","The slow is applied to all enemy units within the radius of a smashed Stone Remnant.

What the craftsmen had not known was that within the strange seam of jade flowed the spirit of the Earth itself--an elemental force at one with the planet. When the force within the carved jade found itself cut off from the life's blood of the world, it gathered its strength over the course of a thousand years and dug itself free and into the light.

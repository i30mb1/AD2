Though frail, this icy elemental caster possesses strong semi-spammable spells and a painful global ultimate. Cold Feet harms enemies and will also stun them unless they move away from the cast area, making the spell dangerous when used in conjunction with disables from allies. Ice Vortex is a low-cooldown zoning ability, applying a heavy slow and magic damage amplification to nearby enemies. This combines effectively with Chilling Touch, which endows Kaldr with enhanced magic damage from great range. His ultimate Ice Blast is one of the game's most devastating spells, with a global range and a radius that increases the further the blast travels. All enemies struck by it endure hefty damage, are temporarily prevented from healing or regenerating, and instantly perish if their health falls too low. Ancient Apparition can be devastating in team fights, and makes an excellent counter to heroes who rely on healing and regeneration.",

Some believe that as the cosmos ages and approaches its final moments, the brightness and power of Kaldr will also intensify\u2014that the Ancient Apparition will grow younger and stronger as eternity's end draws nigh. His grip of ice will bring all matter to a stop, his image will cast a light too terrible to behold. An Apparition no longer!",

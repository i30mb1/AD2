It required no technology, no wands or appurtenances other than the mind of the magician. All the trappings of ritual were merely mnemonic devices, meant to allow the practitioner to recall in rich detail the specific mental formulae that unlocked a spell's power. The greatest mages in those days were the ones blessed with the greatest memories, and yet so complex were the invocations that all wizards were forced to specialize. The most devoted might hope in a lifetime to have adequate recollection of three spells\u2014four at most. Ordinary wizards were content to know two, and it was not uncommon for a village mage to know only one\u2014with even that requiring him to consult grimoires as an aid against forgetfulness on the rare occasions when he might be called to use it. But among these early practitioners there was one exception, a genius of vast intellect and prodigious memory who came to be known as the Invoker. In his youth, the precocious wizard mastered not four, not five, not even seven incantations: He could command no fewer than ten spells, and cast them instantly. Many more he learned but found useless, and would practice once then purge from his mind forever, to make room for more practical invocations. One such spell was the Sempiternal Cantrap\u2014a longevity spell of such power that those who cast it in the world's first days are among us still (unless they have been crushed to atoms). Most of these quasi-immortals live quietly, afraid to admit their secret: But Invoker is not one to keep his gifts hidden. He is ancient, learned beyond all others, and his mind somehow still has space to contain an immense sense of his own worth...as well as the Invocations with which he amuses himself through the long slow twilight of the world's dying days.","trivia":["In the earliest version of Invoker, the order of instances mattered when Invoke was cast. Invoker, therefore, had access to 27 spells, including most of the 10 still in the game (though with some differences). For more information, see here.","Invoker is (or used to be) a Magus like Rubick, who calls him the Arsenal Magus.","Invoker's Deafening Blast cast response \"Sonic boom!\" is a reference to the signature move of Guile from the Street Fighter fighting game series.","Invoker (Along with some players and casters) sometimes jokingly refers to his Chaos Meteor as a meatball ( \"Behold the meatball!\"), due to their highly similar appearance.","One of Invoker's lines when he casts Chaos Meteor is \"Gallaron's Abyssal Carnesphere!\" Carne is Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, and Italian for meat, and a sphere is the geometric shape of a ball. So, \"carnesphere\" is another way of saying \"meatball\".","Invoker's preferred style of spellcasting, involving the invocation of mnemonics, is inspired by the magic in Jack Vance's Dying Earth series. Further references to Vancian magic are in the alternate names for his spells, which involve verbose invocations such as \"Sadron's Protracted Frisson\" and \"Killing Wall of Koryx.\".","Invoker's line for purchasing a Blink Dagger \"Dagger of the mind.\" references the \"Dagger\" monologue from Shakespeare's play, Macbeth.","Invoker's respawn line \"Knowing me... knowing you.\" references the song by the band Abba, of the same name.","Invoker's voice actor, Dennis Bateman, also voices the Spy from Team Fortress 2. Invoker's killing response \"You die as you lived: insipid and ignorant.\" is a reference to this, as the Spy also has 2 similar killing responses: \"You died as you lived: running away!\" and \"You died as you lived: morbidly obese!\".","As referenced in the details of his name, Invoker was known as Kael, or Kael'thas Sunstrider, in DotA. Kael'thas is best known as the Lord of the Blood Elves in the Warcraft universe. The Invoker of DotA also makes use of his Warcraft 3 model and voice. Skywrath Mage's responses when meeting Invoker may also be related to this, as Dragonus was also a blood elf in DotA.","The first letter of Quas, Wex and Exort refers to the key of a QWERTY keyboard they are by default bound to (Q, W, and E). In lore, they are most likely mnemonics used to invoke spells."],"talents":["+2 Forged Spirit Armor Reduction:Radial Deafening Blast","+50 Alacrity Damage\/Speed:-10s Tornado Cooldown","-10s Cold Snap Cooldown:+1 Forged Spirit Summoned","+40 Chaos Meteor Contact Damage:-30s Ghost Walk Cooldown"],"desc":"Carl, the Invoker, is a ranged intelligence hero who is very difficult to master. He is unique in that he possesses a total of 14 abilities in his arsenal; three of them - Quas, Wex, and Exort - are reagents and one is his special ultimate Invoke. The three abilities he learns throughout leveling up can have three instances, which serve as the basic ingredients or components for him to create a new ability using his ultimate. Once the reagents or elements are combined, he can invoke one out of ten different abilities. All of his invoked abilities are capable of a multitude of actions, from damaging enemies to aiding his allies, and even saving himself from danger. His three reagents can be upgraded up to level 7 which determines the power and potency of his invoked abilities, making it more powerful than an ordinary spell. Because of this, he can be played in almost any role possible. Invoker can be a carry, semi-carry, ganker, pusher, initiator or even support. His three reagents provide a passive bonus per instance, allowing for specialization at early levels and situational boosts at later levels. His extremely flexible nature allows him to use many different combinations of items effectively but also make him dependent on solid builds and a good gold advantage."}

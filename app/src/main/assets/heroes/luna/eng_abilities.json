This means a missed or disjointed attack does not proc it.","Despite the ability's appearance, its effects fully count as a passive spell, and not as attacks. This means, besides the damage being based on Luna's attack damage, and it proccing on attacks, the ability has nothing to do with attacks. The bouncing glaives' damage count as spell damage, however, they ignore spell damage amplification and cannot spell lifesteal. They do not proc any attack modifier, and are not treated as an attack by any on-hit effect, like Return. This also means they completely ignore evasion. However, damage block does reduce their damage.","A bouncing glaive can be disjointed. When disjointed, the disjointing unit is not registered as hit, meaning the glaive can immediately bounce on it again if within range.","A disjointed bounce still counts as a bounce, so it reduces the amount of bounces left and the damage of the next bounce.","It does not matter how much damage the initial target from the attack takes, the bounces always deal damage based on Luna's average main damage + bonus damage.

She was once the Scourge of the Plains, a merciless leader of men and beasts, and able to sow terror wherever she dared. Now she was far from her homeland, driven half mad from starvation and months of wandering, her army long dead or worse. As she stood at the edge of an ancient forest, a pair of glowing eyes spied on from an elder branch. Something beautiful and deadly sought a meal in the wilting dusk. Without a sound, it turned and left. Fury overtook her. Clutching a rust-eaten dagger, she charged after the beast determined to reclaim even a shred of her past glory, but her quarry would not be caught. Three times she cornered the creature among the rocks and trees, and three times she pounced only to witness its fading shadow darting further into the woods. Yet the full moon shone brightly, and the creature's trail was easy to follow. Arriving in a clearing atop a high hill, the beast's massive feline form sat in the open, attentive and waiting. When the woman brandished her dagger, the creature reared and roared and charged. Death, it seemed, had come for her at long last in this strange place. She stood, calm and ready. A flash of movement, and the beast snatched the dagger from her hand before vanishing into the forest. Stillness. Hooded figures approached. In reverent tones they revealed that Selemene, Goddess of the Moon, had chosen her, had guided her, had tested her. Unwittingly she had endured the sacred rites of the Dark Moon, warriors of the Nightsilver Woods. She was offered a choice: join the Dark Moon and pledge herself to the service of Selemene, or leave and never return. She did not hesitate. Embracing her absolution, she renounced her bloody past, and took up a new mantle as Luna of the Dark Moon, the dreaded Moon Rider, ruthless and ever-loyal guardian of the Nightsilver Woods.","talentsTips":["The all stats talent effectively grants Luna 144 health, 0.8 health regen, 0.64% magic resistance, 1.6 armor, 10 attack speed, 0.5% movement speed, 96 mana, 0.4 mana regen, 0.56% spell damage and 8 attack damage.","The lifesteal talent stacks additively with other sources of lifesteal."],"trivia":["In DotA, Luna was a Night Elf.

Even though she can be seen as a tempting target for enemy heroes, Luna possesses solid early game laning presence due to her Lucent Beams, a cheap, low-cooldown nuke, and her Lunar Blessing aura, which grants all nearby allied heroes increased damage. Mid-game, she becomes far more formidable with Moon Glaives, allowing her to kill entire creep waves with two to three attacks, and Eclipse, which can very quickly kill a hero if that hero is unfortunate enough to catch its full blast. Her Achilles' Heel is her fragility; she has no escape abilities and cannot handle a lot of punishment, relying on her movement speed to keep her out of harm's way.

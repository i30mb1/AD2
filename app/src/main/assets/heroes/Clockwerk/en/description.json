Rattletrap's wide array of disables and nukes allows him to cause chaos among the enemy team and break up their formation, giving his team a powerful advantage in any fight. Battery Assault allows Clockwerk to inflict repeated damage ticks and mini-stuns on nearby enemies, allowing him to constantly hinder any enemies he manages to get close to and single out. He can also disrupt enemy movement and pen in foes with his Power Cogs, which induces an electric shock to foes outside, stunning them while damaging them and burning their mana, and can render enemies caught inside helpless. His damage nuke, Rocket Flare, gives him global nuking power that also provides scouting vision for him and his team. Finally, his ultimate, Hookshot, allows Rattletrap to instantaneously latch onto and stun a foe from long range, making him a very strong ganker. Few can escape Clockwerk once he has his sights locked in, and his machinations make him a powerful ally to have on any team.",
  "history": "Rattletrap descends from the same far-flung kindred as Sniper and Tinker, and like many of the Keen Folk, has offset his diminutive stature through the application of gadgetry and wit. The son of the son of a clockmaker, Rattletrap was many years apprenticed to that trade before war rode down from the mountains and swept the plains villages free of such innocent vocations. \"Your new trade is battle,\" his dying father told him as the village of their ancestors lay in charred and smoking ruins. It is a poor tradesman who blames his tools, and Rattletrap was never one to make excuses. After burying his father among the ruins of their village, he set about to transform himself into the greatest tool of warfare that any world had ever seen. He vowed to never again be caught unprepared, instead using his talents to assemble a suit of powered Clockwerk armor to make the knights of other lands look like tin cans by comparison. Now Rattletrap is alive with devices, a small but deadly warrior whose skills at ambush and destruction have risen to near-automated levels of efficiency. An artisan of death, his mechanizations make short work of the unwary, heralding a new dawn in this age of warfare. What time is it? It's Clockwerk time!",

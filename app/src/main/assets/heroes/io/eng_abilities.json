The tether breaks when the allied unit moves too far away, or Io cancels the tether.","effects":["Ability Target Unit","Affects Allies"],"notes":["Has a Break Tether sub-ability that lets Io break the tether while connected with an ally.","Tethering a unit that is 700 units or further away causes Io to latch on and pull itself to the target. Pulls Io at a speed of 1000, until coming within 300 range of the target. Can pull Io over impassable terrain. Destroys trees within 350 radius around Io right after the pull. If Io breaks the tether while getting pulled to the tethered target, the pull immediately stops. The pull gets interrupted when Io gets stunned, hexed, hidden, feared, hypnotize, or rooted during the pull. Forced movement cancels the pull as well, but only after the movement ends, and not upon getting applied. Taunts, leashes, and silences do not interrupt the pulling. If the distance between Io and the target gets greater than 900 (or 2150 during the pull), the Tether breaks.","When the distance between Io and the tethered target gets greater than 700, the link's visual appearance changes.","Tether has no set duration. It breaks only when exceeding the break distances, when Io or the target die, when Io gets assimilated or when using the sub-spell.","The movement speed bonus is only applied to the tethered ally, while Io copies the target's speed. Io only copies the base speed of the target and any speed bonuses it has, flat and percentage. If the target gets slowed, Io's speed does not copy the movement speed loss caused by the slow. However, Io can be slowed directly by slowing effects, but cannot have its movement speed increased by other sources.","The tethered unit benefits from Overcharge, Relocate, and from Io regenerating or replenishing health and mana. Tethered units still benefit from all those effects even when turning invulnerable or when hidden. The heal and mana restore transfer happen regardless of how much Io actually healed\/restored.","If Io is tethered to an invisible unit, enemies can only see a fake link leading to the invisible unit's last known location.","When the level 25 talent is chosen, Io performs instant attacks on every enemy the tethered ally attacks. The attacks are performed as soon as the ally launches their attack (including instant attacks). It does not matter whether the attack actually hits or not. Does not perform attacks when the tethered target also has this talent (i.e. an illusion of Io). The instant attacks of Io can proc every attack modifier normally.

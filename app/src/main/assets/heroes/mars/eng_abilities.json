Although within the spear's search radius, it does not hit enemies behind Mars upon cast. Can hit units up to 1025\/1125\/1225\/1325 range away (travel distance + radius).","The first hero the spear strikes gets damaged and dragged along with the spear. When not hitting a building, tree, or cliff, the enemy is dragged so that they are 900\/1000\/1100\/1200 range away from the original cast location. When hitting a building, tree, or cliff, the hero is moved closely to the pinned object and stunned. Buildings include every building, enemy and allied ones alike, but excludes the shops. Trees include the trees from Sprout, and Iron Branch, although Iron Branch trees may be hard to hit due to their tiny collision size. Cliffs include all natural cliffs onto elevated areas, as well as Fissure, Ice Shards, Power Cogs, and Arena Of Blood.","A spear may only drag one hero along with it. If that hero dies or gets freed from the spear, it still cannot impale a new hero.","Provides true sight over the impaled enemy. No true sight is applied while dragging the enemy along with the spear.","Upon losing the impale stun debuff, trees within a 100 radius around the hero get destroyed.","Hit non-hero units (including creep-heroes), as well as secondary heroes are damaged and knocked back instead. The knockback direction is based on the angle between the hit unit and the spear. Units are completely disabled during the knockback.","The spear cannot collide with invulnerable or hidden units, it simply flies through them.","The spear provides 500 radius flying vision as it travels. When not impaling a hero to an object, the vision lingers at the final location for 1 second.

Wars of conquest and of vengeance. Just and unjust... Always cruel. So much like his father, Mars indulged his basest impulses--with inclinations much more monstrous than those of Zeus--and he inflicted suffering untold. But as the epochs vanished behind him, the selfish ways of his father--the ways of many amongst his godly kin, they who judged him despicable--eventually began to ring hollow. War for its own sake was no longer enough to satisfy his desires. For the first time in his ageless days, the god of war began to question to what ends he swung his glorious spear. As the Fates would have it, his solution came easily: he must wage war for a larger purpose, and inspire more than mere savagery and sorrow at the sight of his crest. He must at last lay claim to the mantle of leadership that is his birthright, for the time has come to burn down the pantheon of the old age and build a just new empire atop the ashes of his kin. Only then might he find satisfaction, and make the glory of Mars evident to all.","talentsTips":["The strength talent effectively grants Mars 160 health, 0.8 health regen, 0.64% magic resistance and 8 attack damage.","The armor talent does not benefit illusions.","This attack damage talent is added as raw attack damage, so it does not benefit illusions, and is not affected by most percentage-based damage increasing or reducing effects."],"trivia":["Despite being Zeus' son, Mars is named after the Roman god of war, while the Greek equivalent is Ares.

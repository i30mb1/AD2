If no enemies are nearby, affected units stand still. While standing still, they can be given one order which they then execute. This order cannot be manually canceled.

However, if Axe turns visible again, affected units start attacking him again.","The taunt has the same priority as Winter's Curse, but lower priority than Duel. Same priority means that affected units attack the first taunt source, and switch to the other source once the first one expires.

For detailed interactions follow the link.","On the first cast of Summon Spirit Bear, the bear is actually summoned. On every following cast, it is just healed or revived. This means buffs and debuffs are not dispelled upon re-summoning it. Projectiles are not disjointed either.","The backlash damage is dealt as pure damage from the unit that killed the Spirit Bear. Denying the Spirit Bear causes no damage, unless it is killed by neutral creeps.","The Spirit Bear cannot be resummoned if it has taken damage from a player in the last 3 seconds. Has no minimum damage threshold. Damage is checked before any sort of reduction, so fully blocked damage also prevents resummoning it. If the Spirit Bear dies, it can be resummoned immediately.","The Spirit Bear can use every item, except for placing Observer Wards and Sentry Wards. It can also use runes.","Hand of Midas grants Lone Druid the gold and experience when the Spirit Bear uses it.","The Spirit Bear cannot have illusions of itself, so the Illusion Rune and Manta Style do not spawn illusions of the bear.","When the Spirit Bear is 1100 range away from Lone Druid, it gets disarmed, turns slightly grey and uses different animations. The grey hue and disarm symbol are visible to allies only.

Wise and just they were, and focused in their ways to seek an understanding of the natural order. The arch forces of nature saw this, and so sought the most learned among them. Wise old Sylla, clan justiciar and seer, stepped forward for his kin, and to him was given the Seed with these words: 'When all of the world has dimmed, when civilization has left these lands, when the world is slain and wracked by the endless deserts at the end of ages, plant the Seed.' As he grasped his trust, Sylla felt his years recede and his vitality returned. Vast knowledge burst into his mind. He found himself able to project his very will into reality and, with some concentration, alter his own physical form as well. Yet subtle whispers and cruel ears brought word of the Seed and its power to other peoples, and a terrible war crashed upon the Bear Clan. As his ancestral home burned, Sylla took his burden and fled to the wild places. Ages passed, and time and myth forgot the Bear Clan, forgot Sylla and the Seed, forgot wondrous civilizations that rose and fell in Bear Clan's wake. For millenia Sylla has waited, waited for word from his deities, waited for peace to come to the ever warring realms, waited in exile and in secret for the end of all things and for the conclusion of his sacred commitment, preparing himself always to face and destroy whatever would dare threaten his purpose.","talentsTips":["The attack range talent only affects ranged attacks.

With the help of his Spirit Bear, he can carry, jungle, and push lanes effectively. Because of this, technically speaking, the Spirit Bear and Lone Druid himself are two available heroes at once. The Lone Druid himself is mostly played as the aura giver, while the Spirit Bear is played as the main damage dealer and tank. When he activates his abilities, it will not only buff him but the Spirit Bear as well. Lone Druid is versatile as he can change from a fast ranged warrior to a tough and mighty melee bear himself. Together, they can push lanes and towers quickly, farm neutrals in a cinch, and even take down Roshan by themselves if equipped with the right items. Due to the Spirit Bear not benefiting from attributes, it scales weakly into the later portions of the game, encouraging a midgame-oriented playstyle. However, should the need arise, its six extra usable item slots make Lone Druid a force to be reckoned with far into the lategame."}

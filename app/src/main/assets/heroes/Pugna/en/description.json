  "description": "Pugna is a ranged intelligence hero whose spells give him powerful nuking and pushing capability. Nether Blast is a low-cooldown area nuke with slight delay that deals significant damage to buildings, giving Pugna the option to use it both as a basic nuke as well as a pushing spell. Decrepify is a unit-targeted spell that gives its target the ethereal status effect, rendering them unable to take physical damage but also slowing them and decreasing their magic resistance. Nether Ward drops a stationary, ward-like device that severely debilitates enemy casting, dishing out powerful nukes proportional to how mana-intensive the enemies spells are. Pugna's ultimate ability, Life Drain, is a channeling ability that saps enemy health and grants it directly back to himself. It can be cast on allies to give them health and mana as well. With a strong array of nukes and a spell specifically designed to amplify them, Pugna is a force to be reckoned with both in teamfights and solo situations, able to blast his foes into Oblivion quite easily.",
  "history": "In the realm of Pugna's birth, near the vents of the Nether Reaches, there stood a lamasery devoted to the Arts of Oblivion, which drew its power from the nether energies. The Grandmaster of the temple compound had himself passed into Oblivion several years prior, leaving his academy without a leader. From the moment of their master's death, the regents of the temple began rites of divination to identify their master's reincarnation, and eventually all signs converged on the immediate neighborhood. Several villages squatted in the shadow of the temple, their alleys and plazas full of the laughter of squalling children. Pugna, a mere thirteen months of age, was but one candidate among the local brats, and on the appointed day he was presented at the temple alongside two other promising tots. The lamas offered a jumble of worn relics to the children, treasured possessions of their former grandmaster. One boy reached for a porphyry wand that had belonged to the lama...and put it in his nostril. An impish girl pulled out an amulet that had also been the lama's, and immediately swallowed it. Pugna regarded the other two coolly, gave a merry laugh, and blasted them with gouts of emerald flame, reducing them to ashes in an instant. He then snatched up the wand and amulet, saying 'Mine!' The regents hoisted the beaming Pugna on their shoulders, wrapped him in their grandmaster's vestments, and rushed him to the throne before his mood could change. Within five years, the temple itself was another pile of ash, which pleased Pugna to no end.",

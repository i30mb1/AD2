Christened Bristleback by the drunken crowds, he waded into backroom brawls in every road tavern between Slom and Elze, until his exploits finally caught the eye of a barkeep in need of an enforcer. For a bit of brew, Bristleback was hired to collect tabs, keep the peace, and break the occasional leg or two (or five, in the case of one unfortunate web-hund). After indulging in a night of merriment during which bodily harm was meted out in equal parts upon both delinquent patrons and his own liver, Bristleback finally met his match. \"Your tusks offend me, sir,\" he was heard to drunkenly slur to one particularly large fellow from the northern wastes whose bill had come due. What followed was a fight for the ages. A dozen fighters jumped in. No stool was left unbroken, and in the end, the impossible happened: the tab went unpaid. Over the weeks that followed, Bristleback's wounds healed, and his quills grew back; but an enforcer's honor can be a prickly thing. He paid the tab from his own coin, vowing to track down this northerner and extract redemption. And then he did something he'd never done before: he actually trained, and in so doing made a startling discovery about himself. A smile peeled back from his teeth as he flexed his quills. Turning his back to a fight might be just the thing.","talentsTips":["The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage.","The spell lifesteal talent stacks additively with other sources of spell lifesteal.","The spell lifesteal talent heals for 3% from non-hero units.

His loss of boar-like features in Dota 2 was likely made to distinguish him from the quillboar race in the Warcraft universe.  As well, his hero title shares the name of a large quillboar tribe in World of Warcraft.  Beta information revealed that Bristleback's original name was supposedly to be \"Bristlebog\", probably to avoid conflict with the aforementioned Bristleback tribe in World of Warcraft. According to an unused voice response, Bristleback was originally designed with tusks. According to Lycan's response (Play A boar is a wolf's natural prey), Bristleback was originally designed to be boar-like.","A silhouette of what appears to be Skywrath Mage can be seen in Bristleback's splash artwork, seemingly still having a beta model\/texture."],"talents":["+30 Warpath Damage Per Stack:15% Spell Lifesteal","+25 Quill Stack Damage:+25 Health Regen","+6 Max Goo Stacks:+250 Health","+3 Mana Regen:+20 Movement Speed"],"desc":"Rigwarl the Bristleback is a melee strength hero famous for his array of synergistic, simplistic, and yet effective spells with low mana costs and cooldowns. Though each cast of his spells has relatively weak potency on its own, their instances have a cumulative effect, making the Bristleback quite deadly the longer he stays alive in a fight; this is directly reflected in his ultimate, Warpath, which powers up his movement and attack damage based on the number of spells he recently cast. He is able to increasingly slow his enemies down and reduce their armor with Viscous Nasal Goo and hit them with a barrage of Quill Sprays, making him an effective chaser when ganking enemies. His low strength gain makes him seem less tanky than most strength heroes at first glance, but his signature Bristleback passive substantially reduces all damage he takes from the sides and especially the rear, making him very difficult to bring down if he's facing away from his enemies. In the right hands, Bristleback is a powerful ganker in the early stages of the game, and a powerful hard carry in the later stages depending on how much farm he gets."}

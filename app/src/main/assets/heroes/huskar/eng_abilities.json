Against the ancient rites of the Dezun Order, Huskar\u2019s spirit had been saved from eternity, but like all who encounter the Nothl he found himself irrevocably changed. No longer at the mercy of a mortal body, his very lifeblood became a source of incredible power; every drop spilled was returned tenfold with a fierce, burning energy. However this newfound gift infuriated Huskar, for in his rescue from the Nothl, Dazzle had denied him a place among the gods. He had been denied his own holy sacrifice. In time the elders of the order sought to expand their influence and Huskar, they agreed, would be a formidable tool in their campaign. Yet becoming a mere weapon for the order that denied him his birthright only upset him further. As the first embers of war appeared on the horizon, he fled his ancestral home to find new allies, all the while seeking a cause worthy of unleashing the power his total sacrifice could bring.","talentsTips":["The attack range talent also affects the cast range of Burning Spear.","This attack damage talent is added as raw attack damage, so it does not benefit illusions, and is not affected by most percentage-based damage increasing or reducing effects.","The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage.","The lifesteal talent stacks additively with other sources of lifesteal.","The strength talent effectively grants Huskar 400 health, 2 health regen, 1.6% magic resistance and 20 attack damage."],"trivia":["Huskar's name might be derived from the Old Norse word \"Huskarl\", the title given to the highly-skilled bodyguards of important Norse lords and kings.","His name might also be derived from Huáscar Inca, a leader of the Inca Empire in the 16th century.

He is known to be a powerful adversary in most games because his damage-per-second attacks can easily kill almost all heroes at any point in the game, assuming no one is nearby to save them. Unlike many other heroes, Huskar does not require much mana to use his abilities; rather, he sacrifices his own health to inflict additional damage. His passive, Berserker's Blood, defines the power of sacrifice: Huskar gets more dangerous the more he gets hurt. This ability gives him increased health regen and attack speed depending on how much life he is missing. Combined with the DPS from Burning Spear, the increased attack speed from Berserker's Blood allows Huskar to output colossal damage, which can be used to gain an advantage over the enemies early on during the game. His Life Break is his most dangerous ability, but also his riskiest one: charging towards his target, Huskar sheds a large amount of his life force to cut an equal amount of the target's current health. This is great to use as an initiation spell as it deals a guaranteed percentage damage, allowing Huskar and his allies to feel the pain that the Sacred Warrior felt. Courageous and fearless, Huskar is powerful at any stage of the game and is willing to suffer and face death, for the greater good of taking his allies to victory."}

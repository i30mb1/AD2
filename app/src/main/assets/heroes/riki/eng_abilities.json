The instant attacks can proc any attack modifier or any on-hit effect like regular attacks. If Riki is blinded, the attacks can miss, unless he has True Strike. They can also miss to evasion.

On each instant attack, Riki's facing angle is changed to match the target's direction, which causes the backstab to apply.

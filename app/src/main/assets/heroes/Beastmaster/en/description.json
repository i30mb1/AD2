  "description": "Karroch, the Beastmaster, is a versatile melee strength hero most commonly played as an offlaner and ganker who brings a good amount of utility to his team in any situation. His Wild Axes allows him to lane and farm quite effectively throughout the game, even when pressured. He is able to summon a hawk and boar to aid him, each providing a good amount of utility to his team. Hawks provide free flying vision around the map, scouting his enemies while his Boars can harass and slow his enemies to a crawl while aiding him in combat. His Inner Beast aura makes his team a force to be reckoned with, providing a hefty boost to attack speed to himself, his summons, and all nearby allies. Finally, his ultimate, Primal Roar, is the longest lasting single-target reliable stun in the game and also penetrates spell immunity (being only counterable by Linken's Sphere), providing a strong initiation for his team to claim a kill. With these skills, he can push enemy towers quickly and safely, take down undefended targets with the help of Necronomicon summons, lock down a single target, and also kite enemies in teamfights. With careful observation of the battlefield, Beastmaster takes down enemies one by one and paves the way to victory.",
  "history": "Karroch was born a child of the stocks. His mother died in childbirth; his father, a farrier for the Last King of Slom, was trampled to death when Karroch was five. Afterward Karroch was indentured to the king\u2019s menagerie, where he grew up among all the beasts of the royal court: lions, apes, fell-deer, and things less known, things barely believed in. When the lad was seven, an explorer brought in a beast like none before seen. Dragged before the King in chains, the beast spoke, though its mouth moved not. Its words: a plea for freedom. The King only laughed and ordered the beast perform for his amusement; and when it refused, struck it with the Mad Scepter and ordered it dragged to the stocks. Over the coming months, the boy Karroch sneaked food and medicinal draughts to the wounded creature, but only managed to slow its deterioration. Wordlessly, the beast spoke to the boy, and over time their bond strengthened until the boy found he could hold up his end of a conversation\u2014could in fact speak now to all the creatures of the King's menagerie. On the night the beast died, a rage came over the boy. He incited the animals of the court to rebel and threw open their cages to set them amok on the palace grounds. The Last King was mauled in the mayhem. In the chaos, one regal stag bowed to the boy who had freed him; and with Beastmaster astride him, leapt the high walls of the estate, and escaped. Now a man, Karroch the Beastmaster has not lost his ability to converse with wild creatures. He has grown into a warrior at one with nature\u2019s savagery.",

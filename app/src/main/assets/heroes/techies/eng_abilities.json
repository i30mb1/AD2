Then again, Dredger's Bight no longer exists. Nor does Toterin. Or even Trapper Town. In fact, if one were to track the history of Techies Demolitions they might notice that shortly after Techies appear, towns tend to disappear. Like every inevitable disaster surrounding Techies, the obliteration of Dredger's Bight began with an invention. Tasked with designing a safer way of detonating explosives in the mines beneath the city, pyrotechnic prodigies Squee, Spleen, and Spoon developed their most outlandish creation yet: a button which, when pressed, would trigger a distant device to spark a fuse. Overeager to test their invention, the trio stuffed barrel after barrel with flamesalt explosives, piling every corner of their tiny workshop high with the newly developed remote bombs. From this stockpile they plucked a single payload, burying it in a far away field. As they cowered in a ditch, Spleen pressed the detonator button. Yet after a moment, nothing happened. Confused, he stood up, pressing his button again and again until, finally, an explosion tore a hole in the field. Elated, Squee and Spleen turned toward home just as a massive wave of sound and force arrived to knock them over. Bewildered, their ears ringing from the unexpected blast, they gathered in the dingy miasma to see a smoking ruin where their workshop once stood. Chunks of wood and stone continued to fall as the yawning crater before them slowly deepened into an expanding pit. The whole of Dredger's Bight shuddered, and then gradually started to slide into the mines below as its panicked residents fled. Sitting at the edge of their sinking home they grinned and giggled, as giddy at the possibilities as they were oblivious to the scorn of their former neighbors. They wondered only one thing: how could they trigger an even bigger blast?","talentsTips":["The magic resistance talent stacks multiplicatively with other sources of magic resistance.","The magic resistance talent increases Techies's magic resistance to 43.75%.","Gold granted from the talent is unreliable gold.","This attack damage talent is added as raw attack damage, so it does not benefit illusions, and is not affected by most percentage-based damage increasing or reducing effects."],"trivia":["Before their release, Techies were showcased at the All-Star match of The International 2014, used by Artour \"Arteezy\" Babaev. He originally picked Sniper, but right before the picking phase ended, his pick got replaced by Techies, fireworks were launched in the arena, Techies' portrait was shown on all screens and this sound effect played.","According to Techies' in-game lip syncing, Squee is the one sitting on the cart with the rocket launcher, the cigar, and the deeper voice, Spleen is the big one pushing the cart, with the high voice, and Spoon is the one inside the barrel, who rarely ever talks, but has the deepest sounding voice.","Techies' lines \"They're going to have to glue you back together! Yeah, in Hell!\" and \"We're a sorry buncha losers.

Darn!\".","Techies' attack line \"See! Fore!\" is a pun on the plastic explosive C-4.","The line \"Who said we couldn't count to three, huh?\" is a reference to a joke about the fact that Valve has not released a single game with the number three in the title (Half-Life 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3 etc.).","The line \"Continue testing.\" is a reference to GLaDOS, a character of Valve's Portal series.","The line \"Claymore! But not that kind of claymore.\" is a reference to the M18 Claymore mine.","The gag about Spoon being hidden in a barrel without the other two knowing is a reference to DotA, where only some time after Techies were released did people realize that there were actually three of them instead of two; the third one's feet could barely be seen under the barrel behind the other two (Techies used to be named \"Squee and Spleen\" and eventually became \"Squee, Spleen and Spoon\"). The name \"Spoon\" may be a reference to a scene from the movie Matrix where a boy bends a spoon with his mind and then says to Neo \"Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible. Instead, only try to realise the truth\", followed by Neo asking: \"What truth?\" and the boy answering it with \"There is no spoon. Then you'll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.\" Squee and Spleen think that Spoon died to the explosion in their workshop, so they thought \"there is no Spoon\" anymore and the voice is only in their heads .","The names of the original two Techies most likely came from Magic the Gathering.

And . . . hmm, looks like a spleen.\")","There is a hidden trollface in Remote Mines' ability icon.","Squee's design resembles that of the Soldier from Team Fortress 2, as his eyes are covered by a helmet, and he wields what appears to be a rocket launcher.","The line \"Loud noises!\" is a reference to Brick Tamland, a character from Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy."],"talents":["+25 Mines Movement Speed:+251 Damage","+150 Gold\/Min:+50 Movement Speed","+6 Mana Regen:+300 Blast Off Damage","-4s Proximity Mines Cooldown:+25% Magic Resistance"],"desc":"Squee, Spleen, and Spoon, the Techies, are a trio of ranged intelligence heroes, known for laying deadly traps around the field with a wide array of mines."}

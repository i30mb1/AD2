Commanding them well requires adept micromanagement and map awareness, but once mastered Chen becomes an effective ganker and one of the game's strongest early pushers. His ability to convert creeps makes it natural for him to spend the laning phase as a jungler, emerging to pick off enemies with his creep army's array of disables. Chen's ultimate Hand of God heals all his creeps and allied heroes wherever they are on the map, allowing him to sustain pushes and secure objectives. And that he must, building up a strong lead before his creeps lose their threat in the late game.",
  "history": "Born in the godless Hazhadal Barrens, Chen came of age among the outlaw tribes who eked out an existence in the shimmering heat of the desert. Using an ancient form of animal enthrallment, Chen\u2019s people husbanded the hardy desert locuthi, a stunted species of burrowing dragon that melted desert sands into tubes of glass where twice-a-year rains collected. Always on the edge of starvation and thirst, fighting amongst their neighbors and each other, Chen\u2019s clan made the mistake, one fateful day, of ambushing the wrong caravan. In the vicious battle that followed, Chen\u2019s clan was outmatched. The armored Knights of the Fold made short work of the enthralled locuthi, who attacked and died in waves. With their dragons dead, the tribesmen followed. Chen struggled, and slashed, and clawed, and perished\u2014or would have. Defeated, on his knees, he faced his execution with humility, offering his neck to the blade. Moved by Chen\u2019s obvious courage, the executioner halted his sword. Instead of the blade, Chen was given a choice: death or conversion. Chen took to the faith with a ferocity. He joined the Fold and earned his armor one bloody conversion at a time. Now, with the fanaticism of a convert, and with his powers of animal enthrallment at their peak, he seeks out unbelievers and introduces them to their final reward.",

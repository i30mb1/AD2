They are the fractured remnant of a once-great civilization\u2014a fallen tribe, their stormcraft strange and inscrutable, cobbled together from scraps of lost knowledge which even they no longer fully understand. For those on the high plain, weather has become a kind of religion, worshiped as both the giver and taker of life. But the electrical storms that bring life-sustaining rains arrive at a cost, and many are the charred and smoking corpses left in their wake. Although small for his kind, Disruptor is fearless, and driven by an insatiable curiosity. As a youth, while still unblooded and without a stryder, he explored the ruins of the ancestral cities\u2014searching through collapsed and long-moldering libraries, rummaging through rusting manufactories. He took what he needed and returned to his tribe. Adapting a coil of ancient design, he harnessed the power of electrical differential and now calls down the thunder whenever he wishes. Part magic, part craftsmanship, his coils hold in their glowing plates the power of life and death\u2014a power wielded with precision against the landed castes to the South, and any interlopers who cross into ancient Oglodi lands.","talentsTips":["The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage.","Gold granted from the talent is unreliable gold."],"trivia":["When first released in DotA his hero title was actually \"Far Seer\" which is a hero title belonging to the Orc faction in Warcraft III.

They can only turn by moving in approximately 150 radius arcs.","Spirits automatically attack nearby enemies within the 700 radius around Death Prophet. They choose their target randomly, but prioritize units Death Prophet is attacking currently. Once having chosen a target, a spirit usually sticks to that target until it dies, gets out of range, or until Death Prophet attacks a new target. A spirit's ongoing chase cannot be canceled. A spirit only stops chasing its target after reaching it, or when the distance gets greater than 1900. This means when giving Death Prophet an attack order, already attacking spirits do not switch targets. Although chasing for much further, the spirits cannot damage units which are 1200 range away from Death Prophet. After each attack, the spirits need to return to Death Prophet before being able to attack again.","The spirits can attack every attackable enemy unit, including buildings, wards, and units inside the Fog of War, but not invisible units. Spirits do not choose invulnerable or ethereal units as their attack targets, but will continue to attack a unit if turns invulnerable or ethereal after already acquired as a target.","The attacks of the spirits are not regular attacks, so they fully ignore things like evasion and damage block. They deal spell damage, not attack damage, so they are affected by spell amplification and spell lifesteal. This also means that they cannot trigger the on-attack effects of Counter Helix, Moment of Courage and Reactive Armor or break enemy Tranquil Boots. They also cannot damage units which require a certain amount of attacks to be killed, since they do not count as regular attacks.","When a spirit gets 2000 range away from Death Prophet, it disappears and then respawns from Death Prophet. Reappearing spirits are still bound to the spawn interval, so when multiple spirits disappear, they do not reappear simultaneously on Death Prophet.","The spirits heal Death Prophet upon returning once the duration is up. They do not heal her upon returning after each attack. The heal amount per spirit is based on their damage value, and not on how much damage they actually dealt. This means upon having fully returned, a spirit heals Death Prophet for 14.75-16 for each attack it did, regardless of how much damage the enemies actually took.","Recasting Exorcism causes the previous cast to end prematurely, making the spirits start returning to Death Prophet and heal her.","Choosing the haste talent immediately applies the haste to the currently active Exorcism instance.","The spirits spawned with Aghanim's Scepter behave like the spirits from a regular cast, meaning they still obey the max distances, and have the same move behaviors. A spirit spawns for every unit hit by Crypt Swarm, and Silence, for the Spirit Siphon target, and for every unit hit by Death Prophet's regular attacks. If Spirit Siphon is blocked with Spell Block, or if her attack is evaded or disjointed, no spirit spawns. Spirits also spawn for buildings when attacking them, but not for wards or allies. These spirits deal 103.25-112 damage, and therefore also heal for 25.8125-28 health upon returning.

But after years of inquiring on behalf of others, she began to seek clues on her own fate. When death refused to yield its secrets, she tried to buy them with her life. But the ultimate price proved insufficient. Death disgorged her again and again, always holding back its deepest mysteries. Her jealousy grew. Others could die for eternity\u2014why not she? Why must she alone be cast back on the shores of life with such tiresome regularity? Why was she not worthy of the one thing all other living creatures took for granted? Still, she would not be discouraged. Each time she returned from the grave, she brought a bit of death back with her. Wraiths followed her like fragments of her shattered soul; her blood grew thin and ectoplasmic; the feasting creatures of twilight took her for their kin. She gave a little of her life with every demise, and it began to seem as if her end was in sight. With her dedication to death redoubled, and no client other than herself, Krobelus threw herself ever more fervently into death's abyss, intent on fulfilling the one prophecy that eluded her: That someday the Death Prophet would return from death no more.","talentsTips":["The cast range talent also affects the max distance of Crypt Swarm and the link break distance of Spirit Siphon.","The magic resistance talent stacks multiplicatively with other sources of magic resistance.","The magic resistance talent increases Death Prophet's magic resistance to 36.25%.","This attack damage talent is added as raw attack damage, so it does not benefit illusions, and is not affected by most percentage-based damage increasing or reducing effects.","The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage."],"trivia":["At some point, she, along with Io and Silencer, had her costume and ability color palettes changed.

She is often played in the mid lane, since her Crypt Swarm gives her strong magic damage that can be spammed to her heart's content. As she levels her ultimate, Exorcism, Death Prophet can deal a huge amount of damage to towers and heroes alike, while healing at the end of the duration. If Exorcism's own heal isn't enough, she still has Spirit Siphon which drains health based on the target's health and can even be used on multiple targets at the same time. Finally, her Silence gives her a powerful tool to disable enemy casters and heroes that rely on escape abilities. Because she can deal large amounts of damage over time with her ultimate and Crypt Swarm, Death Prophet is mostly built as a tank, to ensure she can continue to stay in the fight."}

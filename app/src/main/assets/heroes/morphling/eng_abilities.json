Morph only copies the target's model (including the cosmetic items they wear). This means he is still registered as Morphling, so that innate passive abilities of the target are not gained. For example, when morphing into Faceless Void, Morphling still gets frozen by Chronosphere. This also means that Morphling can still be killed normally in the morphed form, since it is still him and not a separate clone or illusion. Buffs and debuffs Morphling receives during it stay on him upon unmorphing. Most channeling abilities are interrupted upon unmorphing, except for Phase Shift, Upheaval, and item abilities.","Also copies the target's attribute values, primary attribute, movement speed, attack range and range type. This means when targeting a melee strength hero, Morphling becomes a melee strength hero for the duration. Only copies the target's base attributes. Bonus attributes from abilities and items are not copied. Talent bonuses are generally not copied either.

This also includes spells Invoker had invoked, or any non-ultimate Rubick had stolen upon morphing into them.","Morphling keeps his own items during Morph, he does not copy the target's items. This means when Morphling has Aghanim's Scepter, it upgrades every upgradable spell Morphling copies with Morph.

Cannot be cast on creep-heroes. When cast on illusions, it copies the hero who owns the illusion, and not the hero the illusion is based on.

On the eve of the ancient war of the Vloy, it punched down through the sky and lit a glowing trail across the night, a sign both armies took for an omen. The frozen ball melted in a flash of boiling heat, as below two forces enjoined in battle across the border of a narrow river. Thus freed from its icy stasis, the Morphling was born into conflict, an elemental power at one with the tides of the ocean, capricious and unconstrained. He entered the fight, instinctively taking the form of the first general who dared set foot across the water, and then struck him dead. As the motley warriors clashed, he shifted from form to form throughout the battle, instantly absorbing the ways of these strange creatures--now a footsoldier, now an archer, now the cavalryman--until, by the time the last soldier fell, Morphling had played every part.

Waveform lets him surge directly forward to a location, damaging enemies on his path, working both as a nuke or an escape. Adaptive Strike is an interesting scaling two-part ability that blasts enemies with magical water, either stunning and knocking back or dealing damage. Its power is based on either agility or strength. Attribute Shift allows him to edit his physical being, switching it from Agility or Strength, transforming him into a strong damage dealer or a tank. His ultimate, Morph, transforms him into a copy of an enemy using their stats and basic abilities."}

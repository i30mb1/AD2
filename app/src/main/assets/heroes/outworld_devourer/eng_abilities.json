This means it is not affected or considered by anything that works with attack damage. This also means that it fully works with spell damage amplification and spell lifesteal.","Deals its damage before the attack damage is applied, but still depends on the attack hitting the target.","Checks Outworld Devourer's mana pool upon projectile hit, so increasing or decreasing his mana pool while the projectile flies does affect its damage.","Steals intelligence after applying its damage, so newly increased mana pool does not affect the attack's damage. The intelligence loss on the target does not keep the current mana percentage, but instead removes 12 mana per intelligence from the current mana pool. The intelligence gain on Outworld Devourer keeps the current mana percentage, without adding any extra mana.","Upon losing the debuff, the target keeps their current mana percentage, but also gets 12 mana per intelligence added to their mana pool again. This means the target effectively regains more mana than it lost initially.","The intelligence loss on Outworld Devourer upon losing the buff keeps the current mana percentage, just like upon gaining the buff.","Cannot steal intelligence from illusions or from Meepo clones. Can steal from Tempest Doubles.","Cannot reduce enemy intelligence below 0, but Outworld Devourer always gains the full amount of intelligence, no matter how much the target has left.","Targeted non-intelligence heroes effectively lose 12\/24\/36\/48 mana, 0.05\/0.1\/0.15\/0.2 mana regen and 0.07%\/0.14%\/0.21%\/0.28% spell damage.

From this jagged crystalline Outworld, forever on guard, he has gazed for eternities into the heavens, alert for any stirring in the bottomless night beyond the stars. Imprinted deep in the shining lattices of his intellect lies a resonant pattern akin to prophecy, a dark music implying that eventually some evil will wake out there, beyond the edges of creation, and turn its attention to our world. With his whole being focused on his vigil, Outworld Devourer paid little attention to events closer in to the sun. But at last the clamor of the Ancients, and a sense of growing threat from within as well as without, sent him winging sunward to visit the plains of war. Harbinger's place in our own prophecies is unambiguous: he must be considered an omen of worse things to come.

This was changed to \"Outworld Demolisher\" on the Test Client, but due to community outcry, it was changed again when it arrived on the main client to his current name, \"Outworld Devourer\". Due to such name changes, there are many community humour names in circulation, such as \"Outworld Developer\" and \"Outhouse Decorator\".","Outworld Devourer has lines for carrying two, three or even four Aghanim's Scepter.

With Arcane Orb, his damage output is reliant on his intelligence attribute and the size of his mana pool, so he must focus more or less exclusively on items which augment them. Though he lacks somewhat in range and has no innate mobility skills, Arcane Orb deals Pure damage and steals intelligence, meaning that if he gains an advantage in a match he deals constant, colossal damage which cannot be decreased or resisted except with total spell immunity and gets stronger with each hit. He enjoys more-or-less unlimited mana because of his Equilibrium, which can be activated to replenish his mana from the damage dealt by his spells. With Astral Imprisonment, Harbinger can render himself or an ally invulnerable for a short period of time, or disable the target enemy. His ultimate, Sanity's Eclipse, can instantly deal colossal area-of-effect damage against his enemies based on how much greater his intelligence is than theirs."}

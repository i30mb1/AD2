Causes the towers to perform instant attacks on the closest 4 enemies within attack range whenever they launch an attack projectile. This means all projectiles are released at the same time together with the main attack. Therefore, it does not matter whether the primary attack misses or not, the extra projectiles are still released. Does not target wards, buildings, invisible units, attack immune units, or units inside the Fog of War, but does target couriers. However, attacking wards or buildings still causes secondary projectiles to hit valid targets within the radius."],"elements":["Ability Target Unit","Affects Allies"],"description":"Targets a building, restoring 40% of its health over 30 seconds.

  "tips": [
    "This item is particularly strong in boosting your midgame. Plenty of stats, movement speed, and status resistance it is very strong on most melee carries.",
    "If you still have a Sange and Yasha by the time you get to the late-game, it may be wise to disassemble it and build the Yasha into a Manta Style, and the Sange into a Heaven's Halberd. The actives from those items are extremely helpful, and the stat bonuses are great."

This means that incoming damage amplifiers can be used to counter the effect.","Also grants the wielder 100% outgoing damage reduction, so they deal no damage if not affected by outgoing damage amplification.","Also grants 75% status resistance, which stacks diminishingly with other sources of status resistance. The only exception is Enrage, which does not stack with Combo Break. Enrage's status resistance takes priority.","The damage instance triggering Combo Breaker is negated.

Such heroes include Nyx Assassin, Skywrath Mage, Necrophos or Templar Assassin. Conversely, heroes that rely on quick bursts of damage may be better off not buying Aeon Disk, as they could waste their own spells upon attempted retaliation. Aeon Disk also provides protection from heroes with strong initiation tools like Earthshaker or Magnus, as (most of) their disable durations will be reduced and their team cannot provide immediate follow-up damage to their initiation.","Consider purchasing a Blink Dagger or other mobility items with Aeon Disk, as one can use it during Combo Breaker's duration, allowing a quick escape, provided it has not been disabled beforehand. It can also be used to initiate with, protecting you should you either miss your ability or if there are enemy heroes that you missed.","Summoned units are not affected by the outgoing damage negation by Combo Breaker. Heroes such as Witch Doctor, Shadow Shaman or Lone Druid can still be able to retaliate on their attacker while being briefly protected.","Other protective items like Linken's Sphere or Black King Bar can help delay Combo Breaker's activation in a teamfight, preventing it from being wasted by either a stray spell or a long-distance attack.","The item can save a split pusher from getting killed while being far from his team to run back or teleport to base.","Aeon Disk could be a not so good choice against disables that can't be dispelled like Black Hole, Chronosphere, Static Storm, Doom etc, but still will give a dispellable 2.5 second protection.","Techies mines deal full damage while they are under the effect of Combo Breaker."],"attrs":["Passive Combo Breaker","Bonus +300 Health +300 Mana","Disassemble?

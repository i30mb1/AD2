This means it does not cancel channeling spells of the target. However, it interrupts the user's channeling spells upon cast, since it is a single target spell. It is not the push itself canceling them.","Does not push units affected by Black Hole, Chronosphere, Duel, or Flaming Lasso.","Cannot push units through Kinetic Fields or Arenas of Blood.","If the target is affected by Soulbind, it cannot push the unit further than its max stretch distance allows.","If the target is leashed by Pounce, the leash gets instantly broken upon cast. However, if the target gets leashed after cast, it cannot push the unit further than the max stretch distance of Pounce allows.","Cannot be cast on wards or buildings. Can be cast on Homing Missiles.","Can move units over impassable terrain. Trees within 100 radius around the pushed target get destroyed during the push.","Can be cast on Roshan but without any effect, since Roshan is immune to forced movement.","Shares cooldown with Hurricane Pike.

And it can be upgraded into an hurricane pike even for melee heroes late game to get extra stats compared to the blink dagger.","Force Staff is the cheapest item to disable a Linken's Sphere allowing you to use more powerful spells like Hex from a Scythe of Vyse and\/or Soul Rend from Bloodthorn.","When chasing enemies, the Force Staff can be used to chase down enemies easily and disable them although one should use it with extreme caution."],"attrs":["Active Force","Bonus +10 Intelligence +2.5 Health regeneration","Disassemble?

Pushes the caster and target at a speed of 2250, if the target is an enemy.","Targeting allies pushes them based on their facing direction. Targeting enemies pushes them based on the caster's facing direction. The caster is pushed into the opposite direction, adding a 900 range distance between the caster and targeted enemy. The caster is only pushed when the target was an enemy, not an ally.","The unlimited attack range only works against the targeted enemy. Attacking other units still uses the regular attack range.","Same goes for the attack speed. When switching targets uses regular attack speed. Updates the speed upon reaching attack point.","Gives the caster an attack order on the target if the target is an enemy. This effect works exclusively for ranged heroes.","The push does not disable, so the caster and the targeted unit can still cast spells or items, attack and turn during the push. This also means that it does not cancel channeling spells of the target.","Does not push units affected by Black Hole, Chronosphere, Duel, or Kinetic Field. If the target is an enemy, not even the push on the caster or the unlimited attack range are applied.","If the target is an ally, and is leashed by Pounce, the leash gets instantly broken upon cast. However, it cannot break the leash when getting leashed during the push. The pushed unit gets stopped at Pounce's max radius.","Can target any unit, except for wards and buildings. It can also push a Homing Missile.","Can force units over impassable terrain. Trees within 100 radius around the pushed units get destroyed during the push.","Can be cast on Roshan but without any effect, since Roshan is immune to forced movement (still applies its effects on the caster).","Casting on self or allies uses the default Force Staff sound.","Shares cooldown with Force Staff."],"elements":["Ability Target Unit","Affects Enemies \/ Allies"],"description":"Pushes you and target enemy 450 units away from each other, and for 5 seconds, allows you to make 4 attacks against the target without range restrictions and with +100 attack speed.

Alternatively, you either need a spell of your own to give you vision over the enemy (such as Weaver's The Swarm), or work with an ally to keep vision over him ( Bounty Hunter's Track is the obvious choice, Thundergod's Wrath, Corrosive Haze, Thunder Strike, Haunt also work, to name a few).","Hurricane Pike can be used as an escape mechanism by pushing away persistent enemies.","Enemies can be pushed away in mid-air, like during Earthshaker's upgraded Enchant Totem and units Tossed by Tiny.","It is possible to propel yourself through Disruptor's Kinetic Field by using the active on an enemy with your back toward the rim, pushing yourself backwards through the barrier.

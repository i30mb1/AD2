{"abilities":[{"effects":["Attack Speed Bonus: 490","Number of Attacks: 1","Move Speed Slow: 100%","Slow Duration: 0.8"],"notes":["This ability works exclusively for melee heroes.","Upon proccing, grants the user 490 attack speed until the next attack. This means it does not provide guaranteed full attack speed and can be countered by strong attack speed slows. The attack speed buff has no set duration. It lasts until the user makes a second attack, no matter how long they wait. The attack speed is granted as soon as the attack point of the first is reached and last until the attack point of the second attack is reached.","Since it is a simple attack speed bonus, it is possible to cancel the second attack and \"store\" the attack speed for later.","The second attack is not an instant attack. It uses regular attack animation times and attack cooldowns.","The movement speed slow is applied on the proccing attack and on the attack after the proccing attack. This means it is possible to slow two enemies with one proc, by switching attack targets after the proccing attack.","The attacks first apply the debuff, then their own damage.","Echo Strike triggers on instant attacks as well, applying the slow. The attack speed is wasted, though, since they are instant attacks.","The slow of multiple instances does not stack, but refreshes the duration instead.","Procs on anything, including buildings, wards and allies. The slow fully applies to allies, but not to buildings and wards."],"elements":["Ability Passive","Affects Enemies"],"description":"Causes melee attacks to attack twice in quick succession.

A Skull Basher is also good to get a chance to bash from the two quick attacks. You can combine the echo sabre with a Daedalus and Satanic's active to instantly restore your HP.","Echo Sabre's ability is effectively a passive 1-hit-only Overpower. This makes it a great item on heroes whose passive abilities rely on attack speed to be effective, similar to how Ursa's Fury Swipes relies on the attack speed of Overpower.","The attack speed from the passive proc lasts until a second attack is done. This makes it possible to \"store\" the massive attack speed bonus for a planned strike on an enemy. One just has to attack a creep to proc the passive ability and immediately cancel the second attack. The stored attack speed can come very handy when ganking enemies which have strong attack speed slows like Enchantress with her Untouchable or Phoenix's Fire Spirits."],"attrs":["Passive Echo Strike","Bonus +12 Strength +10 Intelligence +10 Attack speed +1.25 Mana regeneration +12 Attack damage","Disassemble?

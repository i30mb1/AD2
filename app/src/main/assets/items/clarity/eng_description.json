In some situations however, it may be worth it to use it in combat. Even one second of regeneration can be enough to squeeze out one more ability, which can prevent deaths or result in kills.","Although it regenerates quite a lot of mana, it takes long to do so. It is best used while doing other out-of-combat things, so you do not stand and wait for it to finish regenerating. This makes them perfect for roaming heroes, who can use a Clarity while moving between the lanes, allowing them to roam for longer and not have to retreat to the fountain to refill their mana. They are also great for jungling heroes who can use them while killing neutral creeps.","Due to its low cost, don't hesitate to buy and use a Clarity on an ally in lane, especially if it will give them enough mana to get off another escape or nuke ability."],"attrs":["Active Replenish","Charges 1","Disassemble?

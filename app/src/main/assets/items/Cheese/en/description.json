    "Cheese is completely sharable. Although Cheese cannot be bought, it can be sold for 500 gold. However, only the hero whose main inventory it enters first can sell it. If a courier is the first unit to pick up the Cheese, it cannot be sold by anyone, even if it remains on the courier or is given to a hero afterwards. If a Cheese directly enters a backpack when picked up, it remains sellable by anyone until it enters any unit's main inventory.",

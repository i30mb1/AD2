    "The high damage block of Crimson Guard's active is good against illusions because their low damage is heavily reduced or negated completely.",
    "Similarly, it is good against small summons such as Undying's zombies, Broodmother's spiderlings, or Nature's Prophet's treants to name a few.",
    "Crimson Guard is effective against armor reduction as the damage block takes effect before the damage reduction of armor. This means that if incoming damage is actually going to be amplified due to negative armor, a large portion of it can be blocked before it is amplified.",
    "The damage block and armor reduces a lot the damage returned by an enemy Blade Mail.",
    "Best combined with Pipe of Insight or other sources of barrier."

    "Refresher Shard is completely sharable. Although Refresher Shard cannot be bought, it can be sold for 500 gold. However, only the hero whose main inventory it enters first can sell it.

If a Refresher Shard directly enters a backpack when picked up, it remains sellable by anyone until it enters any unit's main inventory.",

  "tips": [
    "The Refresher Shard is basically a Refresher Orb with a single charge, so the same tips apply to it.",
    "However, due to it having no mana cost, and no gold cost, it opens a lot of possibilities for heroes who normally don't or can't buy a Refresher Orb, either due to the lack of mana supporting combos, being unable to farm it up, or it being too ineffective for the item slot.",
    "The Refresher Shard does not share a cooldown with Refresher Orb. Combined with the lack of a mana cost, this means it makes it possible for heroes who already have a Refresher Orb to use their spells three times in a fight.",
    "In some scenarios, it might be worth it to sell the Refresher Shard for its selling price of gold to buy a key item sooner rather than consuming it."

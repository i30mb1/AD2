    "Vladmir's Offering is normally picked up in the early-mid game as it cannot be upgraded into a better item. Its wide variety of bonuses and useful components makes it an attractive choice for melee heroes.",
    "In the lategame a support should pick it up for the lifesteal and damage auras, as the item slot is usually not worth it on core heroes, who need bigger items.",
    "Vladmir's Offering assists with pushing due to conferring damage and lifesteal to nearby creeps, making them withstand enemy attacks longer, with increased dps.",
    "Since Vladmir's Aura can't be toggled off, its status buff icon is always visible on creeps. Therefore it is possible to detect invisible enemy heroes holding Vladmir's Offering by checking enemy creeps' status buff icons."

  "tips": [
    "The Armlet is the most cost-effective item to build, especially on strength heroes that benefit most from its DPS increase. It is also useful on heroes with illusions or abilities that increase their base damage (like Sven's ultimate).",
    "When toggled on, Armlet increases maximum and current health by 500. This means when not at full health, it can effectively work as a temporary heal. However, it also has the opposite effect when toggling off, instantly reducing the hero's health by 500 (but not below 1). When toggled properly, this allows heroes at low health to survive and turn fights.",
    "This item is very good with lifesteal, and if the user's damage output is high enough it can negate the health loss, depending on the amount of lifesteal the user has.",
    "The Heart of Tarrasque's passive regen vastly overturns the health loss, allowing to have the Armlet constantly active, as long as the heart does not get disabled. The health loss of Armlet does not disable the regeneration of Heart of Tarrasque either, since it is considered HP Removal.",
    "Lone Druid's Spirit Bear is normally affected by the health drain, but does not benefit from the strength bonus."

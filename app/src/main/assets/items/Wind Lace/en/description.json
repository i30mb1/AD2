  "tips": [
    "Wind Lace is a great item for supports who sometimes struggle to get Boots of Speed. It costs half as much as boots and gives enough movement speed to get along better. It also builds into typical support items.",
    "A Wind Lace combined with simple Boots of Speed grants more movement speed than Power Treads, Arcane Boots and Phase Boots, making them a cheaper viable option if only movement speed is needed. It also grants almost as much speed as active Tranquil Boots.",
    "Wind lace can be combined with its upgrades (Drum of Endurance, Eul's Scepter of Divinity and Solar Crest) for a further increase in movement speed. It fully stacks with them."

    "Satanic's active ability, Unholy Rage, has quite a short duration. If the enemy has many disables, it is recommended to get a Black King Bar first and use them together, or wait for the main disables to get used first and then join the fight.",
    "Since lifesteal heals for the actual amount of damage dealt, attacking targets with low armor and damage reduction and\/or obtaining high amounts of attack damage can greatly increase the survivability in a fight. With high enough attack damage, one critical strike during Unholy Rage can potentially fully restore the user's health.",
    "Missing an attack does not grant lifesteal. Consider a Monkey King Bar if an opponent has evasion.",
    "Lifesteal is more efficient with defensive items that give Effective Hit Points like Armor, Damage Block, Evasion and Magic Resistance than items that only give HP."

    "The ability to reflect single-target spells back to their casters is actually an old ability concept in Dota. It was first seen in version 6.00 as a chance-based passive ability, belonging to Linken's Mirror, the pre-rework version of Linken's Sphere. The ability was removed in 6.09 and replaced by Spell Block, as Linken's Sphere got reworked."

One mango usually restores enough mana for most spells in the early game, allowing heroes to use a spell immediately.","Even when not really getting the chance to use them, the gold is not wasted on them, since they boost health regeneration while in the inventory.","Although a Clarity restores more mana for much less gold, the fact that mangoes restore instantly makes them more valuable in combat than clarities.

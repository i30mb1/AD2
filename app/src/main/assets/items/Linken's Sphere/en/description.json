    "As Linken's Sphere was originally created, it was named Linken's Mirror or Linken's Mirror Shield. Its ability was Spell Mirror, which was basically a chance-based Echo Shell from Lotus Orb. The item was reworked into the present version in 6.09."

  "tips": [
    "Although Heroes that solely have single-target abilities (like Bane and Lion) seem like they would be rendered harmless with Linken's Sphere, this actually means they would be able to bypass the Spellblock much more easily than Heroes with only one single-target spell (like Lina or Wraith King), as Linken's Sphere only blocks one spell at a time.",
    "As such, when facing against an enemy with Linken's Sphere, it's best to use a cheap, spammable spell like Stifling Dagger or Fade Bolt to put the item on cooldown so that you or an ally can then use more powerful spells like Reaper's Scythe or Doom.",
    "It is wise to Transfer Spellblock on your allied initiator or carry to prevent them from being disabled immediately when charging into the enemy team.",
    "It is good to purchase this item on Heroes that use invisibility or are going to buy items that grant it, as the Spell Block can prevent some spells, such as Corrosive Haze, from revealing the Hero or Duel, from locking down your Hero for a long duration. If the enemy lacks any detection but has strong burst damage, Spellblock may also prevent some disables or ultimates from locking and bursting down your Hero before your fade time, or at least give you a warning that you are about to be targeted.",
    "This item can be useful on heroes with quick escape options such as Clinkz, Ember Spirit, Storm Spirit or Weaver as Linken's Sphere can easily make you almost immune to enemy ganks by blocking any enemy's spell - protecting you from a potential disable and also giving you an early warning that the enemy is coming, allowing you to make your escape.",
    "Projectile-based spells are always blocked upon impact. This makes them easier to blocked for an ally, than spells with instant effect, because Transfer Spellblock can be placed on the targeted ally before the projectile hits.",
    "Linken's Sphere is a good combination with Black King Bar, because it can force enemy hero to cast his most powerful singe-targeted ability on you. However, spending two inventory slots on defensive items means less room for damage and utility items, so think before you buy."

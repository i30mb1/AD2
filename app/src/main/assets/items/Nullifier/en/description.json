        "Nullifier first applies the dispel, then the debuff.",
        "The slow immediately triggers on the target upon projectile hit as well, so that it gets slowed on hit. When the target already has the Nullify debuff, refreshing it with a new cast does not trigger the slow.",
        "When the target already has the Nullify debuff, refreshing it with a new cast does not trigger the slow.",
        "After that, the slow triggers on every successful attack hitting the target. This means missed attacks do not trigger it. The slow does not trigger when the target turns ethereal before attack projectiles hit it.",
        "The slow does not trigger when the target turns ethereal before attack projectiles hit it.",
        "The slow has no trigger cooldown, so that the target can get slowed for the whole duration if it gets hit by an attack at least once every 0.5 seconds.",
        "Can be cast on invulnerable units, applying the dispel and the debuff if the invulnerability can be dispelled. However, if the invulnerability cannot be dispelled, the debuff cannot be applied, but can be refreshed, if already debuffed.",
        "However, if the invulnerability cannot be dispelled, the debuff cannot be applied, but can be refreshed, if already debuffed.",
        "Despite the internal modification's name. Nullifier does not mute the target."

  "tips": [
    "Because this item has a short range and slow projectile speed, it is easier to land from a melee hero with a Blink Dagger, Shadow Blade or ability to close the distance.",
    "A ranged hero should usually instead buy a Scythe of Vyse especially if they are an Intelligence hero.",
    "Use Nullifier on heroes with defensive items like Glimmer Cape, Eul's Scepter of Divinity and Ghost Scepter.",
    "Nullifier is a reliable way to dispel Satanic, which makes it useful aganist hard carries.",
    "Since Force Staff is dispellable, Nullifier will stop enemy heroes after they have been pushed a very short distance.",
    "Use it on heroes that use dispellable Buffs on themselves to escape or deal\/prevent damage like Windrun and Flame Guard.",
    "Use it on heroes with illusions to keep track of the real hero. Combine it with Radiance or other AOE damage over time to keep them slowed ."

The buff and debuff are independent and stack with each other, although the heal gets canceled as soon as the damage ticks. Spirit Vessel's heal does not stack with that of Urn of Shadows. Neither do their damage debuffs stack. Spirit Vessel overrides the heal buff and damage debuff of Urn of Shadows, but the urn cannot override the vessel's modifiers. When attempting to do so, Urn of Shadows only goes on cooldown, without losing charges.","Can regenerate up to 240 health over its full duration.","Deals 25 + 5% of current health as damage in 1 second intervals, starting 1 second after cast, resulting in 8 damage instances. The flat damage is calculated first (after all reductions), followed by the damage based on current health. Can deal a total of 200 + 33.66% of current health as damage to the target enemy (before reductions).","Damage greater than 0 from any player (including allies, excluding self) or Roshan dispels the effect. Does not get dispelled by damage flagged as HP Removal.","Can only be cast on heroes (including illusions and clones) and creep-heroes.","Shares cooldown with Urn of Shadows.","When having multiple Spirit Vessels, the one in the higher inventory slot gains charges. Slot priority order: Top left, top middle, top right, bottom left, bottom middle, bottom right. Cannot gain charges while inside the backpack. The item must be in one of the 6 slots to gain charges. When having no charges left, the vessel gains 2 charges from the next enemy hero's death, instead of 1. When there are multiple Spirit Vessels in the team, the hero who is closest to the dying enemy gets charges. Spirit Vessels and Urns of Shadows are treated equally. When having both, the one in the higher inventory slot gets charges.","Upon upgrading an Urn of Shadows into a Spirit Vessel, all its current charges are carried over."],"elements":["Ability Target Unit","Affects Allied Heroes \/ Enemy Heroes","Damage Magical"],"name":"Soul Release","description":"When used against enemies, it reduces health by 5% of current health per second, and reduces HP regeneration and healing by 70%.

The item decreases a lot the lifesteal from Satanic's active Unholy Rage.","As it is long duration damage-over-time it can be a good counter against Blink Dagger-reliant initiators.","Also it not only decreases but completely disables Heart of Tarrasque for a long duration if not dispelled.","When enemy has Spirit Vessel it's better to have at least one dispel in your team.

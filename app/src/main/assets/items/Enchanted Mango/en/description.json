  "tips": [
    "Enchanted Mangoes are a great source of quick burst of mana. One mango usually restores enough mana for most spells in the early game, allowing heroes to use a spell immediately.",
    "Although a Clarity restores more mana for much less gold, the fact that mangoes restore instantly makes them more valuable in combat than clarities. This makes Enchanted Mangoes a better option for aggressive heroes who want to fight as much as possible."

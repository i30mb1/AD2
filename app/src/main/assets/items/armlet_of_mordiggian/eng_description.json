Increases current health by a total of 500 once all the strength is gained. This health bonus does not count as a heal, so it is unaffected by amplifications, but still does not bypass Ice Blast.","Drains 6 health in 0.11 second intervals, starting 0.11-second after toggled on.","Does not drain health while invulnerable. Health drain cannot bring the user's health below 1. Does not toggle itself off when reaching 1 health.","When toggling off, all bonuses are lost instantly. The strength loss works like the gain, and only affects the maximum health. However, also like upon toggling on, the user loses 20 health per strength, instantly losing up to 500 of current health. This health loss is not lethal either, and cannot drop the user's health below 1.","Unholy Strength does not persist through the user's death. If it was active upon death, the user respawns with it deactivated.","Multiple instances of Unholy Strength do not stack. If multiple Armlets are toggled on, turning off any Armlet removes the Unholy Strength buff.","Assuming no other factors, it takes 10.2 seconds for the health cost to overcome the bonus health on the active.","If a unit is affected by Doom when it gains the active armlet buff (for example, by dropping it and picking it up), their current health will retain the same percentage, instead of being increased by 500 over 0.6 seconds. In this way, while doomed, the +25 str bonus operates in the same manner as conventional strength and health gain."],"elements":["Ability Toggle","Affects Self"],"description":"When active, Unholy Strength grants +31 damage, +25 strength and +4 armor, but drains 54 health per second.

It is also useful on heroes with illusions or abilities that increase their base damage (like Sven's ultimate).","When toggled on, Armlet increases maximum and current health by 500. This means when not at full health, it can effectively work as a temporary heal. However, it also has the opposite effect when toggling off, instantly reducing the hero's health by 500 (but not below 1). When toggled properly, this allows heroes at low health to survive and turn fights.","This item is very good with lifesteal, and if the user's damage output is high enough it can negate the health loss, depending on the amount of lifesteal the user has.","The Heart of Tarrasque's passive regen vastly overturns the health loss, allowing to have the Armlet constantly active, as long as the heart does not get disabled. The health loss of Armlet does not disable the regeneration of Heart of Tarrasque either, since it is considered HP Removal.","Lone Druid's Spirit Bear is normally affected by the health drain, but does not benefit from the strength bonus."],"attrs":["Active Unholy Strength","Bonus +5 Health regeneration +5 Armor +25 Attack speed +15 Attack damage","Disassemble?

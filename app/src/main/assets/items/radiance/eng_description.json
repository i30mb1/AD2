Early deaths can be especially problematic for a Radiance builder, and may force the player to give up on Radiance and build a different item. If you are building a Radiance inform your team.","It is recommended to avoid being visible on the map and avoid uncertain fights when close to the purchase of the Sacred Relic.","With a Manta Style or an illusion ability, you can farm multiple lanes and wood camps at once and push the lanes safely.","Radiance's constant area damage is great at disabling enemy Blink Daggers, preventing enemies from initiating or escaping with it. However, they can still initiate with it if they have enough vision, due to the blink's range being higher than the Burn Aura's reach.","The damage from Radiance procs the Spell Lifesteal provided by Octarine Core. Illusions themselves can recover health while dealing damage to enemy creeps and heroes, allowing them to survive longer. Only the first illusion or hero that burns an enemy lifesteals from it.","It is extremely discouraged to purchase more than one Radiance on the same team, as the auras do not stack."],"attrs":["Passive Burn","Bonus +65 Attack damage","Disassemble?

Dispelling the target does not remove the effect on the caster.","Unlike Medallion, Solar Crest does not place a debuff on the caster. Instead, its effects are directly bound to its cooldown. Its duration is always 7 seconds on the target, while the duration on self can vary when the cooldown gets manipulated. This means when the cooldown is reduced, the reduction effects on self are briefer. The reduction effects on self also disappear immediately when the cooldown is refreshed. This also means that the effects on self are applied when using Medallion of Courage, since they share a cooldown.","The armor reduction on self fully stacks. When having multiple Solar Crests, each of them reduce armor when on cooldown.","The target buff and target debuff fully stack with each other. The effects on self also stack with the target debuff. When a unit is targeted by an allied and an enemy Solar Crest, the modifiers effectively cancel each other out. When opposing heroes cast it on each other, they effectively have -24 armor, -10% movement speed, and -70 attack speed. Multiple target debuffs or target buffs do not stack, but refresh their durations. The target buff, target debuff and self-debuff fully stack with those applied by Medallion of Courage.","Can be cast on any unit, except on wards and buildings."],"elements":["Ability Target Unit","Affects Enemies \/ Allies"],"name":"Shine","description":"When cast on an ally, grants them 12 armor, 70 attack speed, and 10% movement speed.

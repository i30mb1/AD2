        "When targeting the ground, it automatically searches for the closest valid target to teleport to. By default, it only targets buildings. With Boots of Travel, it targets non-hero units as well, and with Boots of Travel 2, it targets heroes as well. Cannot directly target buildings. Instead, it uses the minimum teleport distance. When upgraded, can directly target units.",

        "When not upgraded with Boots of Travel, if multiple heroes teleport to the same location within the check duration, the channeling time increases for each successive hero. The first channel takes 3 seconds, the second 5 seconds, and all following channels take 0.5 seconds longer than the previous one. Teleporting to captured Outposts takes 3 seconds longer than to other buildings, so the first teleport takes 6 seconds. Teleporting towards the fountain always takes 3 seconds, no matter how many targeted that area. The check radius is based on the targeted building's location. Each building has its own independent check radius. Only teleports from non-upgraded Town Portal Scrolls are counted. Teleports enhanced by Boots of Travel are ignored. The teleports do not have to succeed. A canceled teleport still counts and increases following teleport's channeling time.",

The item was available in every game mode until it was fixed\/removed one hour later in a hotfix patch. The item's purpose is unknown, but it was most likely intended to be part of Mutation Mode, due to being added in the same patch that added the Pocket Roshan item.",

  "tips": [
    "Town Portal Scrolls are arguably the most important mobility items in the game and should be carried by every hero. They can easily prevent deaths or make kills possible when used correctly. When getting ganked, the teleport can be used to escape. However, one has to make sure first that the enemy cannot interrupt the teleport, by either waiting until they use their disables first, or by hiding\/obstructing vision in case of single-target disables and teleport while they have no vision. Inversely, they can also be used to teleport to help an ally who is getting ganked. The incoming teleport may cause enemies to retreat and give up chasing the ally and thus not get a kill, or they still go for it and risk losing some of their heroes in return. It is well worth to cancel the teleport if the enemy decides to give up chasing, costing the player 90 , but preventing the enemy from gaining gold and the ally from losing gold and time.",

    "Their cheap cost makes it very easy to buy them frequently, which is fully worth it, even in the very late game.",
    "As a carry, Town Portal Scrolls can be used to speed up farming, by teleporting from lane to lane after clearing the waves through to the enemy's next tower. Instead of having to walk to another place to farm, the teleport can be used to instantly get to the next farm location and keep on farming.",
    "In the lategame, teleport scrolls are crucial to fight against split-pushing enemies. When being far away from a tower which is getting pushed, a teleport is the only way to get there fast and defend the tower. This also goes for base-racing. When the enemy team is faster, teleporting back to base to defend can be the game-winning move."

    "Use the Cyclone offensively by disabling an enemy before a gank, giving you the time to set up your abilities.",
    "Use the Cyclone on fleeing enemies to give your team the time to surround the target.",
    "Use the Cyclone on enemies in teamfights to take them out of the fight for a few seconds. This is especially effective on carries.",
    "Use the Cyclone on yourself during teamfights, baiting enemies into using their abilities on you, then becoming invulnerable to interrupt their burst damage.",
    "Use the Cyclone to buy yourself a little more time for abilities and items to come off cooldown, especially items like Blink Dagger or Blade Mail.",
    "Use the Cyclone on an enemy who has activated items like Blade Mail, Satanic, or Lotus Orb. Doing so will waste the duration of those items.",
    "Eul's Scepter provides a cheap and beneficial dispel for support heroes who are very susceptible to silences. So when facing a lot of silences, or other strong but dispellable effects, Eul's Scepter is usually the best option.",
    "The bonus movement speed works well with other items that increase movement speed, such as Phase Boots."

For example, a hero that is nearly lvl 5 can use Tome to jump all the way to level 6, while a hero that is lvl 24 might receive about 1\/3 of a level from the same tome.","It is recommended that your team allow the first tome to be consumed by someone that is not yet Lvl 6. Ideally, they then use their newly acquired ultimate ability to make a play (such as, to kill an enemy hero) for immediate pay-off.","What your team uses any further tomes for is more debatable. Tomes can be used to put your core heroes even further ahead, or they can be used to help your lower-leveled heroes catch up. In general, they should be used to help your team achieve key hero levels, namely 6\/12\/18 (for ultimates) and 10\/15\/20\/25 (for talents). Keep in mind that some ultimate\/talent upgrades are worth much more than others.","Tome of knowledge is also affected by exp. gain talents which means that if a hero has a 10% increase experience gain talent, then that hero will receive 770xp (if used at exactly at the 10 minute mark, numbers may vary higher) instead of the flat 700xp."],"attrs":["Active Enlighten","Disassemble?

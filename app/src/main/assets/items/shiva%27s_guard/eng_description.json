    "Arctic Blast's effect hits every enemy once within its radius, even after its edge has expanded past the target. Because of its slow expansion time (taking about 2 seconds to reach max radius), it can be thought of as a moving area effect, centered on the hero. Use Arctic Blast before blinking or engaging an enemy to instantly deal area damage and movement slow upon initiation. This can be used to instantly disable enemy Blink Daggers by prematurely using Arctic Blast out of vision and then blinking onto an enemy.",
    "Shiva's Guard is a useful item against enemies with mana burn. It greatly increases a hero's mana pool, and its aura slows the number of mana burning attacks made against its owner.",
    "Shiva's Guard is good against heroes and creeps with low attack speed, causing them to attack even slower."

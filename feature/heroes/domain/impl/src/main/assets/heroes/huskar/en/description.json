Rescued against his will from the Nothl Realm, the revived Huskar found supernatural strength in his own living essence. The Sacred Warrior marks his Spears with blood, setting both weapon and life-force alight before throwing them at his foes. By instantly sacrificing a portion of his health with Life Break, he lunges towards a single target, causing it to lose an even greater portion of its health. With every blow sustained igniting his Inner Fire, the Berserker's Blood redoubled the Sacred Warrior's speed and made him ever more resilient, facing down his opponent in a bloody fervor until he emerged triumphant.  Carry Durable Initiator ","trivia":["Huskar's name might be derived from the Old Norse word \"Huskarl\", the title given to the highly-skilled bodyguards of important Norse lords and kings."],"history":"Emerging from the throes of the sacred Nothl Realm, Huskar opened his eyes to see the prodigal shadow priest Dazzle working a deep incantation over him. Against the ancient rites of the Dezun Order, Huskar's spirit had been saved from eternity, but like all who encounter the Nothl he found himself irrevocably changed. No longer at the mercy of a mortal body, his very lifeblood became a source of incredible power; every drop spilled was returned tenfold with a fierce, burning energy. However this newfound gift infuriated Huskar, for in his rescue from the Nothl, Dazzle had denied him a place among the gods. He had been denied his own holy sacrifice. In time the elders of the order sought to expand their influence and Huskar, they agreed, would be a formidable tool in their campaign. Yet becoming a mere weapon for the order that denied him his birthright only upset him further. As the first embers of war appeared on the horizon, he fled his ancestral home to find new allies, all the while seeking a cause worthy of unleashing the power his total sacrifice could bring.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+20% Life Break Damage","talent_left":"Burning Spears Pure Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+30% Berserker's Blood Regen","talent_left":"-4s Life Break Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+4 Burning Spears DPS","talent_left":"15% Lifesteal"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+0.75s Inner Fire Duration","talent_left":"+2s Life Break Slow Duration"}],"notes":["The lifesteal talent stacks additively with other sources of lifesteal."]}}

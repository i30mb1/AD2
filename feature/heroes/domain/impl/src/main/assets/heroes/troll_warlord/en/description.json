Jah'rakal is an intolerable scoundrel, even for a troll. As such, being kicked out of the troll encampment only served to fuel his anger. The next day, he returned with axes in hand, and slew his former comrades in a Berserker's Rage. With each passing blow, the self-styled Troll Warlord accelerates his swings in an irate Fervor. Instantly able to swap between melee and ranged attacks, he throws his Whirling Axes to cripple from afar, while chopping down adjacent foes. To challenge Jah'rakal is to invite one's own death. The Troll Warlord enters a Battle Trance, channeling pure hatred into unequaled speed as he Rampages forward, decimating his opponents in a storm of bloody axes.  Carry Pusher Disabler Durable ","trivia":["Jah'rakal's lore and certain dialogue lines make several references to Internet trolls, a type of identity or role assumed by certain Internet users.\\"],"history":"It's an easy thing to offend a troll. A prickly and contentious race, trolls thrive on argument and strife, missing no excuse to raise their voices in dispute. Males grow to maturity in subterranean chambers beneath their matriarch's domicile, feeding and amusing themselves while contributing nothing. Often they stay for years beyond the age of maturity, while the matriarch provides them with sustenance. When young trolls are finally pushed from their sub-chamber, they gather with others of their kind, forming roving gangs of malcontents who complain loudly about all manner of vexation. As much as trolls love to argue, imagine how rare it is for a troll to be driven from his own kind for being too difficult to get along with. Such was Jah'rakal's fate, a monger troll from deep in the Hoven. So deluded was he, so bitter and abrasive, that even other trolls found his company intolerable. After one particularly vitriolic outburst in which he claimed the lion's share of loot from their latest raid, his cohorts finally snapped. They turned on him, beat him with clubs, and drove him from the encampment. Enraged at his banishment, he returned the next day, armed with steel, and slew them all, one by one. He then swore a blood oath: he would ever after be a fighting force unto himself. Now he roams the world as the Troll Warlord, bitter and angry, the Imperial high commander of an army of one.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Whirling Axes Pierce Magic Immunity","talent_left":"Battle Trance Strong Dispels"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+20% Battle Trance Movement Speed","talent_left":"+10 Berserker's Rage Armor"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+5 Fervor Attack Speed","talent_left":"+90 Whirling Axes Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+2 Whirling Axes Debuff Duration","talent_left":"+25 Berserker's Rage Movement Speed"}]}}

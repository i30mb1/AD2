Of all the assassins raised by the Sisters of the Veil, only one is known by name: Mortred. Through meditation and prophecy, the order identifies the next target to die at her hands. Attacks miss against the Phantom Assassin as she Blurs into her surroundings, traversing undetected across the land to catch her victims unaware. She opens the encounter with a Stifling Dagger, thrown from the shadows, then leaps upon the crippled target to deliver a flurry of Phantom Strikes, followed by a Fan of Knives hurled into all directions. Without warning, any one of her attacks could be the Coup de Gr√¢ce, leaving behind only the blood-splattered ground as testament to her efficiency.  Carry Escape ","trivia":["Mortred's name is derived from Mordred, a character in the Arthurian legend who betrayed and fought King Arthur at the Battle of Camalann."],"history":"Through a process of divination, children are selected for upbringing by the Sisters of the Veil, an order that considers assassination a sacred part of the natural order. The Veiled Sisters identify targets through meditation and oracular utterances. They accept no contracts, and never seem to pursue targets for political or mercenary reasons. Their killings bear no relation to any recognizable agenda, and can seem to be completely random: A figure of great power is no more likely to be eliminated than a peasant or a well digger. Whatever pattern the killings may contain, it is known only to them. They treat their victims as sacrifices, and death at their hand is considered an honor. Raised with no identity except that of their order, any Phantom Assassin can take the place of any other; their number is not known. Perhaps there are many, perhaps there are few. Nothing is known of what lies under the Phantom Veil. Except that this one, from time to time, when none are near enough to hear, is known to stir her veils with the forbidden whisper of her own name: Mortred.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+7% Coup de Grace chance","talent_left":"Triple Strike Stifling Dagger"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+20% Stifling Dagger Damage","talent_left":"+60 Phantom Strike Attack Speed Bonus"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+25% Blur Evasion","talent_left":"+250 Phantom Strike Cast Range"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+0.5s Phantom Strike Duration","talent_left":"-2s Stifling Dagger Cooldown"}]}}

But he soon realized that few spells were as deadly as the toxins that were his birthright. Exuding an acid that swiftly ate away the bars of his cage, the Netherdrake slipped free of his confines, spit poison in the old spellcaster's eyes, and soared out to let the world know that it had a new master.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-11s Nethertoxin Cooldown","talent_left":"-50% Viper Strike manacost\/cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+80 Viper Strike DPS","talent_left":"+25% Poison Attack slow\/damage"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+40 Nethertoxin Min\/Max Damage","talent_left":"+15% Corrosive Skin Magic Resistance"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+5% Poison Attack Magic Resistance Reduction","talent_left":"+18 Corrosive Skin Damage"}]}}

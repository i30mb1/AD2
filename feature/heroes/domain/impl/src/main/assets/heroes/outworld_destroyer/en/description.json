Wary of the happenings near the central sun, Harbinger departs from his vigil to take his place on the plains of war.

Carry Nuker Disabler ","trivia":["Outworld Destroyer was originally called \"Obsidian Destroyer\" in DotA. Obsidian Destroyer was based on two units in \"Warcraft III: Frozen Throne\"; the Obsidian Statue, and its alternate form, the Destroyer. Outworld Destroyer was originally added to Dota 2 with his current name, but was changed to \"Outworld Demolisher\" before the patch left the Test Client. However, due to community outcry, it was changed to \"Outworld Devourer\" as he arrived on the Main Client. This name was used up until 7.28, where it was changed again to the original Dota 2 iteration of \"Outworld Destroyer\". Due to the many name changes Outworld Destroyer went through, he gained many humorous community names such as \"Outworld Developer\", \"Outsourced Developer\" and \"Outhouse Decorator\".","Outworld Destroyer was originally added to Dota 2 with his current name, but was changed to \"Outworld Demolisher\" before the patch left the Test Client.

From this jagged crystalline Outworld, forever on guard, he has gazed for eternities into the heavens, alert for any stirring in the bottomless night beyond the stars. Imprinted deep in the shining lattices of his intellect lies a resonant pattern akin to prophecy, a dark music implying that eventually some evil will wake out there, beyond the edges of creation, and turn its attention to our world. With his whole being focused on his vigil, Outworld Destroyer paid little attention to events closer in to the sun. But at last the clamor of the Ancients, and a sense of growing threat from within as well as without, sent him winging sunward to visit the plains of war. Harbinger's place in our own prophecies is unambiguous: he must be considered an omen of worse things to come. But his arrival in itself is bad enough.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+2% Arcane Orb Damage","talent_left":"-60s Sanity's Eclipse Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+20 Strength","talent_left":"+0.15 Sanity's Eclipse Mana Difference Multiplier"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+100 Astral Imprisonment Cast Range","talent_left":"+30 Movement Speed"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+200 Health","talent_left":"+20 Attack Speed"}],"notes":["The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage.","The strength talent effectively grants Outworld Destroyer 400 health and 2 health regeneration bonus."]}}

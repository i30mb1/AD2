Converted at sword-point after a disastrous battle, Chen quickly became one of the Fold's most zealous knights. Raised among the clans of the Hazhadal Barrens, Chen adapts his skills of animal enthrallment to perform Holy Persuasions and Martyrdoms, compelling packs of creatures of the forest to fight and sacrifice for his cause. His allies are graced with Divine Favor, while foes are forced to atone through the magnified pains of Penitence. Chen's devotion does not go unrewarded. The Hand of God aids his companions in their quests, intervening at critical moments to heal their injuries and save them from fatal blows.

Using an ancient form of animal enthrallment, Chen's people husbanded the hardy desert locuthi, a stunted species of burrowing dragon that melted desert sands into tubes of glass where twice-a-year rains collected. Always on the edge of starvation and thirst, fighting amongst their neighbors and each other, Chen's clan made the mistake, one fateful day, of ambushing the wrong caravan. In the vicious battle that followed, Chen's clan was outmatched. The armored Knights of the Fold made short work of the enthralled locuthi, who attacked and died in waves. With their dragons dead, the tribesmen followed. Chen struggled, and slashed, and clawed, and perished\u2014or would have. Defeated, on his knees, he faced his execution with humility, offering his neck to the blade. Moved by Chen's obvious courage, the executioner halted his sword. Instead of the blade, Chen was given a choice: death or conversion. Chen took to the faith with a ferocity. He joined the Fold and earned his armor one bloody conversion at a time. Now, with the fanaticism of a convert, and with his powers of animal enthrallment at their peak, he seeks out unbelievers and introduces them to their final reward.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Hand of God applies a Strong Dispel","talent_left":"+200\/+10 Hand of God Heal\/Heal Over Time"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"-30s Hand of God Cooldown","talent_left":"+1200 Holy Persuasion Minimum Health"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+12 Holy Persuasion Damage","talent_left":"+12% Penitence Slow"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"Penitence Deals 225 Damage","talent_left":"-2s Holy Persuasion Teleport Delay"}]}}

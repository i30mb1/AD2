His penetrating intelligence is such that he can never ignore for a moment the agonizing horror at the heart of all creation. Once a great philosopher who sought the meaning of existence, he plumbed the depths of nature with the haunted Chronoptic Crystals, and was forever altered by the hideous mysteries thereby revealed to him. Now the darkest depths of his enlightenment are illumined only by the fitful glare of his arrogance. Like other elemental characters, he is completely at one with nature, but in his case it is a nature lurid and vile. He alone sees the evil truth of reality, and has no use for those who believe the cosmos reserves a special reward for those who practice benevolence.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Lightning Storm Can Bounce Twice On Units","talent_left":"+25 Diabolic Edict Explosions"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+20 Strength","talent_left":"+40 Pulse Nova Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+100 Lightning Storm Damage","talent_left":"+25 Movement Speed"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+1.5 Mana Regen","talent_left":"+40 Split Earth Radius"}],"notes":["The strength talent effectively grants Leshrac 400 health and 2 health regeneration bonus."]}}

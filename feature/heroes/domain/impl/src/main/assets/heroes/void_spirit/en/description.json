Privy to secrets that would shatter a mortal mind, the Void Spirit observes the workings of the universe from an unknowable vantage, choosing to let carefully groomed servants do his bidding -- only emerging from his Hidden Temple into the material plane when he deems that he alone can steer the course of reality along its proper path. With an expansive perspective on existence, Inai is focused intently on a point in time beyond which he cannot see, when the fabrics of multiple realities are fated to collide. Now he steps from the aether to personally resolve the battle of the Ancients and prepare his allies for what he views as a greater conflict to come.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Astral Step 160% Crit","talent_left":"Dissimilate Roots for 2s"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+120 Resonant Pulse Damage","talent_left":"-4 Astral Step Charge Restore Time"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"Remnant Provides 475 True Sight","talent_left":"Outer Dissimilate Ring"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+1.75 Mana Regen","talent_left":"+50 Aether Remnant Damage"}]}}

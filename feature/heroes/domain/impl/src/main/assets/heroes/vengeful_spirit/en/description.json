Robbed of her wings and rightful place in the Ghastly Eyrie, Shendelzare appealed to the goddess Scree'auk to grant her the dark energies that would complete her vengeance. With a Wave of Terror, the fallen princess heralds her arrival, unnerving foes close enough to hear her anguished cry. Like her airborne brethren, the Vengeful Spirit makes liberal use of Magic Missle, a simple Skywrath spell for stunning adversaries. Seeking martyrdom, Shendelzare instantly Displaces herself with a target of her choosing, gladly sacrificing herself as she swaps positions with a besieged ally, or a fleeing enemy. The worthy who fight alongside Shendelzare are emboldened by her Vengeance, a fanaticism that intensifies their blows and persists even beyond her death, as the Vengeful Spirit's presence is felt at all times.  Support Initiator Disabler Nuker Escape ","trivia":["Magic Missile is one of the first and most iconic offensive spells available for arcane spellcaster classes in the famed pen-and-paper RPG series, Dungeons & Dragons.","Previous designs of Vengeful Spirit showed her with a mask that looked similar to her Vengeance Aura ability icon.","Vengeful Spirit's fun name, \"820\", is a tribute to former professional DotA player 820.","In DotA 1, she was the sister of Mortred, the Phantom Assassin, and her name was Shendelzare Silkwood.

But Vengeful Spirit is the essence of vengeance. Once a proud and savage Skywrath scion, Shendelzare was first in succession for the Ghastly Eyrie until a sister's treachery robbed her of her birthright. Snared in an assassin's net, Shendelzare tore free only at the cost of her wings, limping away in the ultimate humiliation: On foot. With her wings broken, she knew the Skywrath would never accept her as ruler; and in the highest roost of the Eyrie, inaccessible except by winged flight, her sister was untouchable. Unwilling to live as a flightless cripple, and desiring revenge far more than earthly power, the fallen princess drove a bargain with the goddess Scree'auk: She surrendered her broken body for an imperishable form of spirit energy, driven by vengeance, capable of doing great damage in the material plane. She may spend eternity flightless, but she will have her revenge.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+16% Vengeance Aura Base Damage Bonus","talent_left":"Magic Missile Pierces Spell Immunity"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+200 Magic Missile Damage","talent_left":"-15s Nether Swap Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-2 Wave of Terror Armor","talent_left":"-2s Magic Missile Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+150 Nether Swap Damage","talent_left":"+125 Magic Missile Cast Range"}]}}

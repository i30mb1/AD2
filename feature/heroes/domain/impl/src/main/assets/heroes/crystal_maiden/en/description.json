Wherever Rylai went, the cold went with her. Fields and orchards withered in her wake, leaving her parents no choice but to pack her off to Icewrack, a realm in the frigid north. Under the tutelage of a hermit wizard, Rylai learned to imprison her enemies with a Thick Block of Ice, holding them in place as she Freezes the Ground. Magic flourishes under her, stimulating Arcane Energy Regeneration in all her companions. In the heat of battle, Rylai keeps a cool head. Channeling her elemental talents, the Crystal Maiden summons enormous shards of ice from the skies, obliterating all foes foolish enough to remain in her Freezing Field.  Support Disabler Nuker ","trivia":["Rylai is one of the oldest heroes from the original DotA in Reign of Chaos DotA. Her title used to be Frost Maiden."],"history":"Born in a temperate realm, raised with her fiery older sister Lina, Rylai the Crystal Maiden soon found that her innate elemental affinity to ice created trouble for all those around her. Wellsprings and mountain rivers froze in moments if she stopped to rest nearby; ripening crops were bitten by frost, and fruiting orchards turned to mazes of ice and came crashing down, spoiled. When their exasperated parents packed Lina off to the equator, Rylai found herself banished to the cold northern realm of Icewrack, where she was taken in by an Ice Wizard who had carved himself a hermitage at the crown of the Blueheart Glacier. After long study, the wizard pronounced her ready for solitary practice and left her to take his place, descending into the glacier to hibernate for a thousand years. Her mastery of the Frozen Arts has only deepened since that time, and now her skills are unmatched.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+1.25s Frostbite Duration","talent_left":"+240 Crystal Nova Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+200 Attack Speed","talent_left":"+50 Freezing Field Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+125 Frostbite Cast Range","talent_left":"-3s Crystal Nova Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+250 Health","talent_left":"+125 Crystal Nova AoE"}],"notes":["The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage."]}}

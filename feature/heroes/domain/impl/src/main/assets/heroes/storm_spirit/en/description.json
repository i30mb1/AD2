In a final act of desperation, the elementalist Thunderkeg cast a suicidal spell that merged his being with the Storm Celestial. From this fusion, the Storm Spirit was born. Now known by his combined name, Raijin Thunderkeg leaves behind crackling Static Remnant of himself, boastful poses that shock foes as he pulls them into an Electric Vortex. Every ability he casts Overloads him with energy, which he gleefully discharges on the next unfortunate target. Like a jolly weatherman, Raijin forecasts victory with a boisterous laugh.

And a boisterous, jovial, irrepressible form it is! As jolly as a favorite uncle, he injects every scene with crackling energy. But it was not always thus, and there was tragedy in his creation. Generations ago, in the plains beyond the Wailing Mountains, a good people lay starving in drought and famine. A simple elementalist, Thunderkeg by name, used a forbidden spell to summon the spirit of the storm, asking for rain. Enraged at this mortal\u2019s presumption, the Storm Celestial known as Raijin lay waste to the land, scouring it bare with winds and flood. Thunderkeg was no match for the Celestial--at least until he cast a suicidal spell that forged their fates into one: he captured the Celestial in the cage of his own body. Trapped together, Thunderkeg's boundless good humor fused with Raijin's crazed energy, creating the jovial Raijin Thunderkeg, a Celestial who walks the world in physical form.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"2x Overload Attack Bounce","talent_left":"500 Distance Auto Remnant in Ball Lightning"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+0.4s Electric Vortex","talent_left":"-1.25s Static Remnant Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+250 Health","talent_left":"+50 Static Remnant Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+20 Attack Speed","talent_left":"+1.5 Mana Regen"}],"notes":["The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage."]}}

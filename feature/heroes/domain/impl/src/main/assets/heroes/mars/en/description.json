Wars of conquest and of vengeance. Just and unjust... Always cruel. So much like his father, Mars indulged his basest impulses--with inclinations much more monstrous than those of Zeus--and he inflicted suffering untold. But as the epochs vanished behind him, the selfish ways of his father--the ways of many amongst his godly kin, they who judged him despicable--eventually began to ring hollow. War for its own sake was no longer enough to satisfy his desires. For the first time in his ageless days, the god of war began to question to what ends he swung his glorious spear. As the Fates would have it, his solution came easily: he must wage war for a larger purpose, and inspire more than mere savagery and sorrow at the sight of his crest. He must at last lay claim to the mantle of leadership that is his birthright, for the time has come to burn down the pantheon of the old age and build a just new empire atop the ashes of his kin. Only then might he find satisfaction, and make the glory of Mars evident to all.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"God's Rebuke +65% Crit","talent_left":"Arena Of Blood Grants Team +180 HP Regen"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+12%\/+6% Bulwark Front\/Side damage reduction","talent_left":"+0.8s Spear of Mars Stun"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-4s God's Rebuke Cooldown","talent_left":"+100 Spear of Mars Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+100 God's Rebuke Distance","talent_left":"+30% Bulwark Active Redirect Chance"}]}}

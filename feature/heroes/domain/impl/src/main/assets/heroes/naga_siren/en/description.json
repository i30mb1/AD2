Once a highly regarded commander of the Slithereen Guard, Slithice fell from honor following a seemingly trivial oversight. She was to find the one stolen chalice, or remain banished forever. Slithice splits a squad of Mirror Images, sending them to scout ahead and Reel In mislead foes. She Ensnares targets in a luminous net, then lashes out with Rip Tides to soften their armor. With the sound of her voice, the enemy halts in mid-swing, lowering their weapons at the sound of a haunting aria. There they will stand, mesmerized, unresponsive to Slithice's encircling allies as they listen to the Siren's Song that has lulled them to their deaths.

In truth, these words are equal parts oath and enforceable covenant, for those who fall short of their duty are banished from the order. To fail is to be other than Slithereen. Once most highly esteemed of her race, Slithice for many years commanded a battalion of her fellows, using her formidable voice as her greatest weapon. Powerful, sinuous, serpentine, she led her deadly Guard in defense of the Deep Ones, and the great wealth of the sunken cities. But in the final battle of Crey, her forces were driven back by a marauding army of levianths intent on finding tribute for their god Maelrawn. After the long and bloody onslaught, as the bodies were cleared from the sunken halls, a single jeweled chalice was found missing from the trove. Of her hundred Guard, only a handful survived, but their bravery and sacrifice were of little consequence. What mattered was that treasure was taken. Honor destroyed. And so Naga Siren was cast out. Banished to search for the stolen chalice. Though she might add a hundred times her weight to the golden trove, she is doomed to live apart until that day she returns that which was taken. For no amount of gold is equal in honor to the honor she lost.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-10s Mirror Image Cooldown","talent_left":"-7 Rip Tide Armor"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+500 Song of the Siren Radius","talent_left":"+1 Mirror Image Illusion"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+13% Mirror Image Damage","talent_left":"+15 Strength"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"-2s Ensnare Cooldown","talent_left":"+30 Rip Tide Damage"}],"notes":["The strength talent effectively grants Naga Siren 300 health and 1.5 health regeneration bonus."]}}

While most would find being kidnapped by a morde-bat to be a terrifying ordeal, one particular young man found the incident exhilarating. Seeking to relive the thrill of flight, he entered the Yama Raskav Jungle, and came out soaring high above the canopy as the Batrider. Atop his leathery mount, he drenches targets below in Sticky Napalm, increasing their flammability before setting the land ablaze by flying up in the sky glowing like a Firefly. To ignite enemies from afar, he hurls an explosive cocktail with an explosion strong enough to knock foes away. Want a ride? That can be arranged. As he spots his targets from above, and throws out his Flaming Lasso to string them along for a fiery experience they will not soon forget.

Emerging from the bloody wreckage and intoxicated by the thrill of flight, the boy realized he'd found his calling. The boy grew, and every summer he'd return to his family's field, often setting out into the bush seeking to reclaim that first thrill of facing death in the form of jaws or a fatal fall. The years went on, but his fire only grew stronger. He studied the overgrowth, plunging deeper with each expedition, until finally he found his way to the caves at the heart of hostility. They say the Rider, on the eve of a scorching summer night, had nothing but a rope, a bottle of liquid courage and a burning determination to feel the skies once more, when he plunged inside\u2026","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+10 Sticky Napalm Damage","talent_left":"Flamebreak applies 2 Sticky Napalm Stacks"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+4.5s Firefly Duration","talent_left":"2 Flamebreak Charges"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+20 Movement Speed","talent_left":"-10s Flaming Lasso Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+50 Sticky Napalm Radius","talent_left":"+75 Flamebreak Knockback Distance"}]}}

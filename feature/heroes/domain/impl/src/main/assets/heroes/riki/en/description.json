With an older brother groomed for the throne, and a younger brother coddled and kept, Riki, the small middle son, seemed born for the art of invisibility. It was an art he cultivated, and one which ultimately saved his life on the night that his people were betrayed and his family slaughtered. Of all the royal line, he alone escaped\u2014small and agile, unassuming, using smoke as cover. He cut his way out of the royal grounds, using the advantage of surprise, quietly slitting the throats of one enemy warrior after another.

He silences his enemies, sharpening his skills, hoping to one day take revenge on those who killed his family and robbed him of his birthright.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-4 Tricks of the Trade Cooldown","talent_left":"Tricks of the Trade Applies a Basic Dispel"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+0.5 Backstab Multiplier","talent_left":"-4s Blink Strike Replenish Time"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"8% Cloak and Dagger Movement Speed","talent_left":"-4s Smoke Screen Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+60 Smoke Screen AoE","talent_left":"+0.4s Blink Strike Slow"}]}}

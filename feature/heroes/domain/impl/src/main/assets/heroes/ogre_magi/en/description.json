Ogres were not known for their intelligence. Thankfully, a two-headed ogre is born once every generation, a blessed individual whose combined brainpower puts him on par with the dullest of single-headed creatures. What he lacks in wits, he makes up for with luck. The Ogre Magi possesses an innate chance to Multicast each ability they cast, Ignite enemies to cinder, quashing enemies by doubling, tripling, even quadrupling the damage from an Unrefined and simple Fireblast, boosting the power of his allies in a frenzied Bloodlust or protecting them in Orbs of Fire.

In his natural state, an ogre is supremely incapable of doing or deciding anything. Clothed in dirt, he sometimes finds himself accidentally draped in animal skins after eating lanekill. Not an especially social creature, he is most often found affectionately consorting with the boulders or tree-stumps he has mistaken for kin (a factor that may explain the ogre's low rate of reproduction). However, once every generation or so, the ogre race is blessed with the birth of a two-headed Ogre Magi, who is immediately given the traditional name of Aggron Stonebreak, the name of the first and perhaps only wise ogre in their line's history. With two heads, Ogre Magi finds it possible to function at a level most other creatures manage with one. And while the Ogre Magi will win no debates (even with itself), it is graced with a divine quality known as Dumb Luck\u2014a propensity for serendipitous strokes of fortune which have allowed the ogre race to flourish in spite of enemies, harsh weather, and an inability to feed itself. It's as if the Goddess of Luck, filled with pity for the sadly inept species, has taken Ogre Magi under her wing. And who could blame her? Poor things.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"17% Fireblast chance on attack","talent_left":"+240 Fireblast Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+30 Strength","talent_left":"+25 Bloodlust AS"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+80 Damage","talent_left":"+250 Health"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+16 Ignite DPS","talent_left":"-1s Fireblast Cooldown"}],"notes":["The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage.","This attack damage talent is added as bonus attack damage.

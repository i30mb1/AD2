A creature hatched into an existence devoid of all feeling but hunger and pain, aeons of carnage shaped the Primal Beast into the apex predator on a planet filled with violent terrors. Desperately banished by would-be masters with failed hopes to control him, the beast was cast into a new world \u2014 one where he could ascend from mere hungry predator into an invasive killing machine with nothing able to stand in his way. For thousands of years, the Mistwood served as massive stomping ground for the beast's destructive play \u2014 and even the feared durana beasts made for tasty snacks. Indeed, there could be no rivals for the beast's territory, only minor annoyances. Until one such tiny annoyance employed vile trickery to trap the unstoppable Beast in the Gleipnir. There he might have remained subdued for eternity, were it not for the unpredictable powers of the Continuum Device. Now, freed from both Gleipnir and Vault, far afield from the Mistwood, and much closer to inhabited lands, the beast sets his snout towards new slaughters and the delights of savage destruction \u2014 and the paltry fires of civilization will do little to keep this ageless monster at bay.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Pulverize Pierces Magic Immunity","talent_left":"+100% Pulverize Duration"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+25% Trample Attack Multiplier","talent_left":"+4 Uproar Armor Per Stack"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-5s Trample Cooldown","talent_left":"Beast dispells himself when activating Uproar"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+90 Onslaught Damage","talent_left":"+20% Magic Resistance During Trample"}]}}

He was the prophesied one, the culmination of two-hundred years of careful pairings, a war-mage who would bring glory to the order, and destruction to their sworn enemies, The Knights of the Fold. Raised with other young mages in a hidden cantonment among the hills of the Hazhadal Barrens, the order's preceptors waited for Nortrom's abilities to manifest. While the other students honed their talents with fire, or ice, or incantatory spells, Nortrom sat silent and talentless, unable to cast so much as a hex. As the day of final testing approached, he still hadn't found his magic. In disgust, the preceptors berated him, while the children laughed. \"You are no mage,\" the head of the order declared. Still, Nortrom did not slink away. He entered the day of testing and faced down the young mages who had mocked him. And then his preceptors learned a valuable lesson: a lack of magic can be the greatest magic of all. Nortrom silenced the young mages one by one and defeated them in single combat, until he alone stood as champion of the Aeol Drias, in fulfillment of the prophecy.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"2 Glaives of Wisdom Bounces","talent_left":"Last Word Mutes"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+10% Glaives of Wisdom Damage","talent_left":"Arcane Curse Undispellable"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-25s Global Silence Cooldown","talent_left":"+0.8x Last Word Int Multiplier"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+12 Arcane Curse Damage","talent_left":"+20 Attack Speed"}]}}

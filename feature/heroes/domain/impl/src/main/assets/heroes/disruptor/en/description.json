From upland Druud, the Stormcrafter known as Disruptor rides down on his stryder to meet those who threaten ancient Oglodi lands. On his back, he carries a device that lets him aim overloaded Thunder Strikes from the skies. The Stormcrafter is able to Glimpse his target back to an earlier location, and erects his Kinetic Field to confine them within a circular barrier. Magic dissipates inside Disruptor's Static Storm, leaving foes caught within no option but to await their own destruction.

His title was changed to Disruptor, since the Far Seer title did not fit him.[1]"],"history":"High on the wind-ravaged steppes of Druud, a gifted young stormcrafter called Disruptor was the first to unlock the secrets of the summer squalls. Constantly under assault from both seasonal storms and encroachment from civilized kingdoms to the South, the upland Oglodi have for centuries struggled to subsist atop the endless tablelands. They are the fractured remnant of a once-great civilization, a fallen tribe, their stormcraft strange and inscrutable, cobbled together from scraps of lost knowledge which even they no longer fully understand. For those on the high plain, weather has become a kind of religion, worshiped as both the giver and taker of life. But the electrical storms that bring life-sustaining rains arrive at a cost, and many are the charred and smoking corpses left in their wake. Although small for his kind, Disruptor is fearless, and driven by an insatiable curiosity. As a youth, while still unblooded and without a stryder, he explored the ruins of the ancestral cities, searching through collapsed and long-moldering libraries, rummaging through rusting manufactories. He took what he needed and returned to his tribe. Adapting a coil of ancient design, he harnessed the power of electrical differential and now calls down the thunder whenever he wishes. Part magic, part craftsmanship, his coils hold in their glowing plates the power of life and death\u2014a power wielded with precision against the landed castes to the South, and any interlopers who cross into ancient Oglodi lands.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-12s Glimpse Cooldown","talent_left":"+200 Static Storm AoE"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+2s Kinetic Field Duration","talent_left":"+3 Thunder Strike Hits"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+250 Glimpse Max Damage","talent_left":"+2s Static Storm Duration"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"-3s Kinetic Field Cooldown","talent_left":"+30 Thunder Strike Damage"}]}}

It is said that none survived the battle at the Trembling Isle, save perhaps, the Admiral of the Claddish fleet. Man or phantom, Kunkka's presence on the battlefield is duly felt by all. Armed with the legendary Tidebringer, the Admiral strikes with a single blow at all who stand before him. A veteran of innumerable naval engagements, Kunkka times his skills with Planned Precision, predicting Tidal Waves and catching opponents in a rising Torrent, disrupting the battlefield with a Storm of Geysers, or summoning the ephemeral Ghostly Shipwreck to dash them upon the rocks. Should his aim prove true, he and his allies will have no trouble cleaning up whatever is left.  Carry Support Disabler Initiator Durable Nuker ","trivia":["Kunkka was named in honour of the artist who made numerous pieces of loading screen art for DotA and Dota 2.[1]"],"history":"As The Admiral of the mighty Claddish Navy, Kunkka was charged with protecting the isles of his homeland when the demons of the Cataract made a concerted grab at the lands of men. After years of small sorties, and increasingly bold and devastating attacks, the demon fleet flung all its carnivorous ships at the Trembling Isle. Desperate, the Suicide-Mages of Cladd committed their ultimate rite, summoning a host of ancestral spirits to protect the fleet. Against the demons, this was just barely enough to turn the tide. As Kunkka watched the demons take his ships down one by one, he had the satisfaction of wearing away their fleet with his ancestral magic. But at the battle's peak, something in the clash of demons, men and atavistic spirits must have stirred a fourth power that had been slumbering in the depths. The waves rose up in towering spouts around the few remaining ships, and Maelrawn the Tentacular appeared amid the fray. His tendrils wove among the ships, drawing demon and human craft together, churning the water and wind into a raging chaos. What happened in the crucible of that storm, none may truly say. The Cataract roars off into the void, deserted by its former denizens. Kunkka is now The Admiral of but one ship, a ghostly rig which endlessly replays the final seconds of its destruction. Whether he died in that crash is anyone's guess. Not even Tidehunter, who summoned Maelrawn, knows for sure.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Ghostship Fleet","talent_left":"-2s Tidebringer Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+80 Torrent AoE","talent_left":"+70% Tidebringer Cleave"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+45 Damage","talent_left":"+30% Torrent Knock Up\/Stun Duration"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"Tidebringer applies 60% slow for 1s","talent_left":"+25% X Marks the Spot Movement Speed"}],"notes":["This attack damage talent is added as bonus attack damage.

What laid under the Juggernaut's mask, none could say. The last of his kind, Yurnero carries alone the martial traditions of his native isle, now sunken forever beneath the waves. Dancing with his Blade, the Juggernaut elevates swordplay to an art form, Swiftly Slashing foes in an unstoppable Blade Fury, striking the most vulnerable spots. With skills honed to such perfection, Yurnero can keep on Slashing and Dashing between opponents while giving them absolutely no chance to retaliate even in the slightest. Their only option to escape this onslaught is to book it as quickly as possible. After eviscerating his foes, Yurnero places his portable mobile Healing Ward that emits meditative energies to revitalize himself and nearby allies.

It is only speculation that he even has one. For defying a corrupt lord, Yurnero was exiled from the ancient Isle of Masks--a punishment that saved his life. The isle soon after vanished beneath the waves in a night of vengeful magic. He alone remains to carry on the Isle's long Juggernaut tradition, one of ritual and swordplay. The last practitioner of the art, Yurnero's confidence and courage are the result of endless practice; his inventive bladework proves that he has never stopped challenging himself. Still, his motives are as unreadable as his expression. For a hero who has lost everything twice over, he fights as if victory is a foregone conclusion.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+2 Healing Ward Health","talent_left":"+1s Omnislash Duration"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+40% Blade Dance Lifesteal","talent_left":"+150 Blade Fury DPS"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-20s Healing Ward Cooldown","talent_left":"+1s Blade Fury Duration"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+5 All Stats","talent_left":"+75 Blade Fury Radius"}],"notes":["The \/ \/ all stats talent effectively grants Juggernaut 100 health, 0.5 health regeneration, 0.83 main armor, 5 attack speed, 60 mana, 0.25 mana regeneration, and 5 main attack damage bonus."]}}

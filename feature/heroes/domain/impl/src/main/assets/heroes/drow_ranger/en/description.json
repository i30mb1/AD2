Her presence was known only from the chill of Frost Arrows, driving deep into her enemies' hearts. Named and raised by the sympathetic Drow, Traxex draws on her heritage to send forth a powerful Gust, silencing and repulsing assailants who venture too close. Although normally aiming for precision, Traxex does not shy away from unorthodox methods, launching a rapid salvo of ice-tipped arrows at multiple targets at once. Honing her skill to peerless precision, the Drow Ranger's legendary Marksmanship only improves with each passing skirmish.  Carry Disabler Pusher ","trivia":["Traxex's original design was slightly different from the one now; aside from the same hood, her white hair was not present, and her eyes were completely white. Her outfit was also slightly more revealing. This was changed with her March 2019 reskin."],"history":"Drow Ranger's given name is Traxex--a name well suited to the short, trollish, rather repulsive Drow people. But Traxex herself is not a Drow. Her parents were travelers in a caravan set upon by bandits, whose noisy slaughter of innocents roused the ire of the quiet Drow people. After the battle settled, the Drow discovered a small girl-child hiding in the ruined wagons, and agreed she could not be abandoned. Even as child, Traxex showed herself naturally adept at the arts they prized: Stealth, silence, subtlety. In spirit, if not in physique, she might have been a Drow changeling, returned to her proper home. But as she grew, she towered above her family and came to think of herself as ugly. After all, her features were smooth and symmetrical, entirely devoid of warts and coarse whiskers. Estranged from her adopted tribe, she withdrew to live alone in the woods. Lost travelers who find their way from the forest sometimes speak of an impossibly beautiful Ranger who peered at them from deep among the trees, then vanished like a dream before they could approach. Lithe and stealthy, icy hot, she moves like mist in silence. That whispering you hear is her frozen arrows finding an enemy's heart.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+12% Marksmanship Chance","talent_left":"+3 Multishot Waves"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+25% Multishot Damage","talent_left":"-4s Gust Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"Gust Reveals Invisible Units","talent_left":"-8s Multishot Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+15% Gust Self Movement Speed","talent_left":"+15 Frost Arrow Damage"}]}}

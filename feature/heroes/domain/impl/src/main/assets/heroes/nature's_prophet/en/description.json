Planted as a seed by the goddess Verodicia, and grown from the remnants of her own body, the Nature's Prophet rose on the vernal equinox to defend the verdant world. Gifted with foresight, Nature's Prophet seems to be everywhere at a moment's notice. Trapping foes with a ring of trees Sprouted from the forest floor and Teleporting at will to any location. The trees around him serve as his objects of power; using them, he instantly summons a Sentient Army of violent trees to fight for him, he attacks where enemies least expect. Channeling the goddess' fury, the Prophet strikes at every intruder in the land, bringing both the Curse of the Oldgrowth and the Wrath of Nature down on all who would do harm to Verodicia's creation.

It pained her to leave the world bereft, for the sprouts had not yet broken through the soil--and they would be tender and vulnerable to every sort of harm. She found in her seed pouch one last seed that she had missed in the sowing. She spoke a single word into the seed and swallowed it as she fell. Her vast body decomposed throughout the long winter, becoming the humus that would feed the seedlings in the spring. And on the morning of the vernal equinox, before the rest of the forest had begun to wake, that last seed ripened and burst in an instant. From it stepped Nature's Prophet, in full leaf, strong and wise, possessing Verodicia's power to foresee where he would be needed most in defense of the green places--and any who might be fortunate enough to call him an ally.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Removed Teleportation Cooldown","talent_left":"2.5x Treant HP\/Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"Sprout Leashes","talent_left":"100% Miss chance for Sprouted units"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+25 Attack Speed","talent_left":"+5 Treants Summoned"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"-8s Nature's Call Cooldown","talent_left":"+30 Wrath of Nature Base Damage"}]}}

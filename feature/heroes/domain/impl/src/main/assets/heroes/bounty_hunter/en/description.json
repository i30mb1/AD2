Fear is the mother of rumor, and tales of Gondar's origins are nothing but hearsay. For the right price, the Bounty Hunter will Track down any target to deliver their heads and collect their bounties. He Walks through Shadows into the best guarded keeps, crippling his target with a surprise attack, and steal some of their riches with a calculated strike. Even targets at a greater distance are not safe from the Bounty Hunter, as his trusty Shuriken seemingly has a mind on its own, seeking out and striking all targets the Bounty Hunter keeps track of. Because in the end, it's all about the gold.

In whispered tones they say he was abandoned as a kit, learning his skill in tracking as a matter of simple survival. Others hear he was an orphan of war, taken in by the great Soruq the Hunter to learn the master's skill with a blade as they plumbed the dark forests for big game. Still others believe he was a lowly street urchin raised among a guild of cutpurses and thieves, trained in the arts of stealth and misdirection. Around campfires in the wild countryside his quarry speaks the rumors of Gondar's work, growing ever more fearful: they say it was he who tracked down the tyrant King Goff years after the mad regent went into hiding, delivering his head and scepter as proof. That it was he who infiltrated the rebel camps at Highseat, finally bringing the legendary thief White Cape to be judged for his crimes. And that it was he who ended the career of Soruq the Hunter, condemned as a criminal for killing the Prince's prized hellkite. The tales of Gondar's incredible skill stretch on, with each daring feat more unbelievable than the last, each target more elusive. For the right price, the hunted know, anyone can be found. For the right price, even the mightiest may find fear in the shadows.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"2 Shuriken Toss Charges","talent_left":"+250 Track Gold"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"Track Grants 600 Ground Vision","talent_left":"+50 Jinada Gold Steal"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"2s Silence on Hit with Shadow Walk","talent_left":"Half Track Bonus Speed to Allies"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+10\/+10% Shadow Walk Attack\/Move Slow","talent_left":"+40 Jinada Damage"}]}}

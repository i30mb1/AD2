We all know the importance of the Drylanders' shipping lanes, how empires may rise and fall according to who controls the open water. Far less is known of the submarine lanes, and how the warring tribes of the Meranthic Diaspora have carved out habitations through endless undersea skirmishes. In the fragile treaties between the Mer and Men, we can glimpse the extent of the drowned empires, but their politics appear complex and opaque. It would seem that Leviathan tired of such petty strife, and set off on his own, loyal only to his abyssal god, Maelrawn the Tentacular. He stalks the shallows now in search of men or meranths who stray into his path, and with a particular loathing for Admiral Kunkka, who has long been his nemesis for reasons lost in the deepest trenches of the sea.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+1s Ravage Stun","talent_left":"50% chance of Anchor Smash on attack"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+40 Kraken Shell Damage Block","talent_left":"Anchor Smash Affect Buildings"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+120 Gush Damage","talent_left":"-25% Anchor Smash Damage Reduction"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+10% Gush Slow","talent_left":"+50 Anchor Smash Damage"}]}}

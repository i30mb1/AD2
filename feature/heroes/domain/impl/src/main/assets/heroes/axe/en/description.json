Absorbing blows from every direction, the indomitable Axe reacts by swinging his axe full circle in a Counter Helix, easily dispatching the swarm he had gathered. But alas, not all stay long enough to meet their end. The few limping away from Mogul Khan feel an inexplicable Battle Hunger, a hunger never sated before Axe slams his Culling Blade through a weakened enemy, sending them to an early grave.

In battle after battle he proved his worth through gory deed. His rise through the ranks was helped by the fact that he never hesitated to decapitate a superior. Through the seven year Campaign of the Thousand Tarns, he distinguished himself in glorious carnage, his star of fame shining ever brighter, while the number of comrades in arms steadily dwindled. On the night of ultimate victory, Axe declared himself the new Red Mist General, and took on the ultimate title of 'Axe.' But his troops now numbered zero. Of course, many had died in battle, but a significant number had also fallen to Axe's blade. Needless to say, most soldiers now shun his leadership. But this matters not a whit to Axe, who knows that a one-man army is by far the best.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+100 Berserker's Call AoE","talent_left":"2x Battle Hunger Armor Multiplier"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+150 Culling Blade Damage","talent_left":"+1 Bonus Armor per Culling Blade Stack"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+12% Battle Hunger Slow","talent_left":"+30 Counter Helix Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+8 Berserker's Call Armor","talent_left":"+12% Movement Speed per Active Battle Hunger"}]}}

Inhabiting the lava tubes below the caldera of Mount Pyrotheos, Black Arachnia grew tired of recent adventurers stepping on her many offspring. And so, the Broodmother set out to rid the world of every potential intruder, one hero at a time. Warm bodies make ideal nurseries, a fact not lost on Black Arachnia as she injects her eggs into dying foes to Spawn Spiderlings. Across patches of land she Spin Webs of Silken Fiber, sheltering herself within to recuperate injuries or laying down Snares to catch her prey. Driven by Insatiable Hunger, the Broodmother goes into a feeding frenzy, sucking the vital fluids from wandering heroes with each bite, replenishing herself for the next spawn cycle.

In a later age, the Vizier of Greed, Ptholopthales, erected his lodestone ziggurat on the slopes of the dead volcano, knowing that any looters who sought his magnetic wealth must survive the spider-haunted passages. After millennia of maternal peace, Black Arachnia found herself beset by a steady trickle of furfeet and cutpurses, bold knights and noble youths--all of them delicious, certainly, and yet tending to create a less than nurturing environment for her innocent offspring. Tiring of the intrusions, she paid a visit to Ptholopthales; and when he proved unwilling to discuss a compromise, she wrapped the Vizier in silk and set him aside to be the centerpiece of a special birthday feast. Unfortunately, the absence of the Magnetic Ziggurat's master merely emboldened a new generation of intruders. When one of her newborns was trodden underfoot by a clumsy adventurer, she reached the end of her silken rope. Broodmother headed for the surface, declaring her intent to rid the world of each and every possible invader, down to the last Hero if necessary, until she could ensure her nursery might once more be a safe and wholesome environment for her precious spiderspawn.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-0.3s BAT during Insatiable Hunger","talent_left":"+35% Silken Bola Slow\/Miss Chance"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"400 AoE Silken Bola","talent_left":"+25 Agility"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-10s Spin Web Recharge Time","talent_left":"+130 Spiderling Health"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+80 Spawn Spiderlings Damage","talent_left":"+3 Spin Web Simultaneous Webs"}],"notes":["The health bonus talent affect both Spiderlings and Spiderites.","The agility talent effectively grants Broodmother 4.17 main armor, 25 attack speed, and 25 main attack damage bonus."]}}

Chosen by the forces of nature for his profound wisdom, Sylla is all that remains of his forgotten clan. The Lone Druid is followed by his Spirit Bear, a powerful companion that Entangles enemies, and Demolishes structures. The sound of a Savage Roar is often all that's needed to frighten foes from the forest. If not, then the pair synergies a Spirit Link, increasing their speed and endurance as they roam the lands for intruders. Man or bear, the distinction is not always clear. When the situation calls for it, the Lone Druid takes his True Form, and joins the mêlée to fight claw-to-claw alongside his bear.  Carry Pusher Durable ","trivia":["Lone Druid's original name was \"Syllabear\", a pun on the name of \"Syl-lab-le\", one of the developers who worked with Guinsoo. Before retiring, he created this hero.[1] It has now been shortened to \"Sylla\"."],"history":"Long before the first words of the first histories there rose the druidic Bear Clan. Wise and just they were, and focused in their ways to seek an understanding of the natural order. The arch forces of nature saw this, and so sought the most learned among them. Wise old Sylla, clan justiciar and seer, stepped forward for his kin, and to him was given the Seed with these words: 'When all of the world has dimmed, when civilization has left these lands, when the world is slain and wracked by the endless deserts at the end of ages, plant the Seed.' As he grasped his trust, Sylla felt his years recede and his vitality returned. Vast knowledge burst into his mind. He found himself able to project his very will into reality and, with some concentration, alter his own physical form as well. Yet subtle whispers and cruel ears brought word of the Seed and its power to other peoples, and a terrible war crashed upon the Bear Clan. As his ancestral home burned, Sylla took his burden and fled to the wild places. Ages passed, and time and myth forgot the Bear Clan, forgot Sylla and the Seed, forgot wondrous civilizations that rose and fell in Bear Clan's wake. For millenia Sylla has waited, waited for word from his deities, waited for peace to come to the ever warring realms, waited in exile and in secret for the end of all things and for the conclusion of his sacred commitment, preparing himself always to face and destroy whatever would dare threaten his purpose.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-0.1 Spirit Bear Attack Time","talent_left":"+1000 True Form and Spirit Bear Health"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"-50s True Form Cooldown","talent_left":"0 Entangle Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-8s Savage Roar Cooldown","talent_left":"+8 Spirit Bear Armor"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+200 Health","talent_left":"+25 Spirit Bear Movement Speed"}],"notes":["The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage."]}}

The beast of bedtime tales, Balanar is the primal terror that every child knows to fear. Once the sun goes down, Night Stalker's hunt begins. Charging through the shadowy forests, he snares prey in a debilitating Void, slowing and forcing his quarry to flee, arms withering and spells fizzling as their hearts are stricken with Crippling Fear. Should sunrise threaten to end his terror, the Hunter in the Night transforms through a Dark Ascension, spreading his wings under the blackened veil of night, and goes on the prowl for ever more victims.

There are ancient tales woven into the lore of every race and every culture, of an impossible time before sunlight and daytime, when night reigned alone and the world was covered with the creatures of darkness--creatures like Balanar the Night Stalker. It is said that on the dawn of the First Day, all the night creatures perished. All, that is, save one. Evil's embodiment, Night Stalker delights in his malevolence. He created the primal role of the Night Terror, the Boogeyman, and as long as there have been younglings, his is the specter summoned to terrify them. This is a role he relishes; nor are these empty theatrics. He does indeed stalk the unwary, the defenseless, those who have strayed beyond the lighted paths or denied the warnings of their communities. Night Stalker serves as living proof that every child's worst nightmare....is true.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+100 Hunter In The Night Attack Speed","talent_left":"-50s Dark Ascension Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"-5s Crippling Fear Cooldown","talent_left":"+20 Strength"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+35 Dark Ascension Damage","talent_left":"+15% Hunter In The Night Status Resistance bonus"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+50 Void Damage","talent_left":"+8s Dark Ascension Duration"}],"notes":["The strength talent effectively grants Night Stalker 400 health, 2 health regeneration, and 20 main attack damage bonus."]}}

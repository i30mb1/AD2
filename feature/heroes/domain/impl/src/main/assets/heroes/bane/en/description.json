Formed from the ichor of Nyctasha, Atropos is the vaporous embodiment of pure fear. Sheer terror Enfeebles his enemies, diminishing their efficiency on the battlefield.

Support Disabler Nuker Durable ","trivia":["The origin of the name \"Atropos\" comes from Greek mythology. One of the Moirai Sisters (commonly referred to as the Sisters of Fate), Atropos was the sister in charge of cutting the \"Life Thread\" of those who were going to die. Her name literally means 'the no-Turning One' (> α 'no, without' + τρέπειν 'to turn'), referring to the irreversible and inevitable destiny of death."],"history":"When the gods have nightmares, it is Bane Elemental who brings them. Also known as Atropos, Bane was born from the midnight terrors of the goddess Nyctasha. A force of terror too powerful to be contained by sleep, he surfaced from her slumbers, fed upon her immortality, and stole his vaporous form from her inky blood. He is the essence of fear. Mortals who hear his voice hear their darkest secrets whispered in their ear. He calls to the hidden fear in every Hero's heart. Wakefulness is no protection, for Bane's black blood, continuously dripping, is a tar that traps his enemies in nightmare. In the presence of Bane, every Hero remembers to fear the dark.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+200 Brain Sap Damage\/Heal","talent_left":"+5s Fiend's Grip Duration"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"-3s Nightmare Cooldown","talent_left":"+30 Movement Speed"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-3s Brain Sap Cooldown","talent_left":"+5% Fiend's Grip Max Mana Drain"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"Nightmare Damage Heals Bane","talent_left":"+20% Enfeeble Cast Range Reduction"}]}}

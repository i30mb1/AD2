The Rogue Knight lives by two creeds: Honor, as ordained by his own personal code, and Solitude. Always eager to charge into a fight. Using his iron gauntlet, he launches a Storm Hammer, stunning grouped enemies as he transports himself into battle, then closes in to cut them down with Great Cleave. Letting out a truly frightening Warcry, he ignites and calls upon God's Strength, a few swings of his gargantuan sword are often more than enough to slay on his hapless foes.

With his father executed for violating the Vigil Codex, and his mother shunned by her wild race, Sven believes that honor is to be found in no social order, but only in himself. After tending his mother through a lingering death, he offered himself as a novice to the Vigil Knights, never revealing his identity. For thirteen years he studied in his father's school, mastering the rigid code that declared his existence an abomination. Then, on the day that should have been his In-Swearing, he seized the Outcast Blade, shattered the Sacred Helm, and burned the Codex in the Vigil's Holy Flame. He strode from Vigil Keep, forever solitary, following his private code to the last strict rune. Still a knight, yes...but a rogue knight. He answers only to himself.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+50% God's Strength Damage","talent_left":"+1.25s Storm Hammer Stun Duration"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+8% Warcry Movement Speed","talent_left":"+10 Warcry Armor"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-15s God's Strength Cooldown","talent_left":"+25% Great Cleave Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+3s Warcry Duration","talent_left":"+15 Attack Speed"}]}}

Sentenced to a slow death by plague, the corrupt cardinal Rotund'jere instead found himself infected, but miraculously immune. Proclaiming himself the Necrophos, he set out to spread disease far and wide. Cloaked in a Ghost Shroud, the cardinal's ethereal presence chills his surroundings, while those who wander too close, seemingly Seeking Death, are struck by waves of Deadly Pulses. The most afflicted are often the first to die. Once his very presence has slowly Stopped their Hearts, he culls the infirm with a single swing of the Reaper's Scythe, permanently boosting his own regeneration. Wherever Necrophos goes, enemies wither as allies thrive.

While others of the order went out to succor the ill, the newly ordained cardinal secluded himself within the Cathedral of Rumusque, busily scheming to acquire the property of dying nobles, promising them spiritual rewards if they signed over their terrestrial domains. As the plague receded to a few stubborn pockets, his behavior came to the attention of the greater order, which found him guilty of heresy and sentenced him to serve in the plague ward, ensorcelled with spells that would ensure him a slow and lingering illness. But they had not counted on his natural immunity. Rotund'jere caught the pox, but instead of dying, found it feeding his power, transforming him into a veritable plague-mage, a Pope of Pestilence. Proclaiming himself the Necrophos, he travels the world, spreading plague wherever he goes, and growing in terrible power with every village his pestilential presence obliterates.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+0.5% Heartstopper Aura","talent_left":"-2.5s Death Pulse Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+15% Ghost Shroud Self Restoration Amp","talent_left":"+32% Heartstopper Regen Reduction"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+24% Ghost Shroud Slow","talent_left":"+32 Death Pulse Heal"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+100 Reaper's Scythe Cast Range","talent_left":"+2s Heartstopper Aura Stack Duration"}]}}

Consumed by the chorus of the unending, Dirge, the Undying one marches across the land, rallying the dead to rise against the living. He Saps the Strength from his enemies, and Rip Souls from close-by beings, searing enemies while infusing allies with health. Atop the battlefield he erects a terrible Tombstone, calling forth legions of clawing zombies to maim and incapacitate his foes.

Dimly he recalls armor and banners and grim-faced kin riding at his side. He remembers a battle: pain and fear as pale hands ripped him from his saddle. He remembers terror as they threw him into the yawning pit of the Dead God alongside his brothers, to hear the Dirge and be consumed into nothingness. In the darkness below, time left them. Thought left them. Sanity left them. Hunger, however, did not. They turned on each other with split fingernails and shattered teeth. Then it came: distant at first, a fragile note at the edge of perception, joined by another, then another, inescapable and unending. The chorus grew into a living wall of sound pulsing in his mind until no other thought survived. With the Dirge consuming him, he opened his arms to the Dead God and welcomed his obliteration. Yet destruction was not what he'd been chosen for. The Dead God demanded war. In the belly of the great nothing, he was granted a new purpose: to spread the Dirge across the land, to rally the sleepless dead against the living. He was to become the Undying, the herald of the Dead God, to rise and fall and rise again whenever his body failed him. To trudge on through death unending, that the Dirge might never end.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Gains Reincarnation 300 CD","talent_left":"+6 Tombstone Attacks to Destroy"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"Tombstone On Death","talent_left":"-2s Decay Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+20 Tombstone Zombie Damage","talent_left":"+10 Soul Rip Damage\/Heal"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+60 Decay Damage","talent_left":"-15s Tombstone Cooldown"}],"notes":["The Zombie attack damage talent is added to the base damage, and not as bonus damage."]}}

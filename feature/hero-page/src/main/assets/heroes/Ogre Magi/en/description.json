  "description": "Aggron Stonebreak, the Ogre Magi, is a melee intelligence hero, famous for his random potential for extreme burst damage and his enormous health pool for an intelligence hero. He has good base attributes, and some of the best attributes gain in the game, having a very high base strength, as well as the highest strength gain of any intelligence hero by far. Coupled with his high base armor and high health regeneration, Ogre Magi is very hard to take down in the early game. He is a powerful ganker and disabler, slowing his enemies first with an Ignite, then proceeding to eliminate his opponents with Fireblast. Later in the game he takes on the role of a buffer\/debuffer with his powerful Bloodlust buff, buffing his carry's damage potential enormously. And if you happen to be skilled enough, his ultimate Multicast gives him the opportunity to randomly cast his spells multiple times, allowing for great burst potential. Ogre Magi is a very strong disabler, requiring nothing but a bit of luck to successfully pull off his powerful Multicasts.",
  "history": "The ordinary ogre is the creature for whom the phrase 'As dumb as a bag of rock hammers' was coined. In his natural state, an ogre is supremely incapable of doing or deciding anything. Clothed in dirt, he sometimes finds himself accidentally draped in animal skins after eating lanekill. Not an especially social creature, he is most often found affectionately consorting with the boulders or tree-stumps he has mistaken for kin (a factor that may explain the ogre's low rate of reproduction). However, once every generation or so, the ogre race is blessed with the birth of a two-headed Ogre Magi, who is immediately given the traditional name of Aggron Stonebreak, the name of the first and perhaps only wise ogre in their line's history. With two heads, Ogre Magi finds it possible to function at a level most other creatures manage with one. And while the Ogre Magi will win no debates (even with itself), it is graced with a divine quality known as Dumb Luck\u2014a propensity for serendipitous strokes of fortune which have allowed the ogre race to flourish in spite of enemies, harsh weather, and an inability to feed itself. It's as if the Goddess of Luck, filled with pity for the sadly inept species, has taken Ogre Magi under her wing. And who could blame her? Poor things.",

All Weavers worked to maintain the fabric of creation, save one Skitskurr, who took it upon himself to create that which had not been woven. Cast out for his ambitions, Skitskurr was now free from his obligations, free to weave a new reality of his own. Opening a gap in spacetime, the Weaver invites \"The Swarm\" \u2014 young Weavers to latch onto enemies, and nibble away at their armor. Nearly impossible to pin down, he slips into micro-wormholes, passing through enemies and reappearing with Shukuchi. The fabric of time frays around Skitskurr, occasionally replaying, causing his Geminate Attacks to be witnessed \u2014 and felt \u2014 more than once. The Weaver takes brinkmanship to an extreme. Fighting to the verge of death, Skitskurr turns back the clock with Time Lapse, reversing his injuries and undoing his foes' efforts, much to their dismay.  Carry Escape ","trivia":["Weaver's original title was Nerubian Weaver, and his original name was Anub'seran. Nerubians are a race of arachnids in the Warcraft universe."],"history":"The fabric of creation needs constant care, lest it grow tattered; for when it unravels, whole worlds come undone. It is the work of the Weavers to keep the fabric tight, to repair worn spots in the mesh of reality. They also defend from the things that gnaw and lay their eggs in frayed regions, whose young can quickly devour an entire universe if the Weavers let their attention lapse. Skitskurr was a master Weaver, charged with keeping one small patch of creation tightly woven and unfaded. But the job was not enough to satisfy. It nagged him that the original work of creation all lay in the past; the Loom had done its work and travelled on. He wanted to create rather than merely maintain\u2014to weave worlds of his own devising. He began making small changes to his domain, but the thrill of creation proved addictive, and his strokes became bolder, pulling against the pattern that the Loom had woven. The guardians came, with their scissors, and Weaver's world was pared off, snipped from the cosmic tapestry, which they rewove without him in it. Skitskurr found himself alone, apart from his kind, a state that would have been torment for any other Weaver. But Skitskurr rejoiced, for now he was free. Free to create for himself, to begin anew. The raw materials he needed to weave a new reality were all around him. All he had to do was tear apart this old world at the seams.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"2 Shukuchi Charges","talent_left":"+1 Geminate Attack"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+90 Geminate Attack Damage","talent_left":"+0.5 Swarm Armor Reduction"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+20 Mana Break","talent_left":"+2 Swarm Attacks to Kill"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+50 Shukuchi Damage","talent_left":"+9 Strength"}],"notes":["The strength talent effectively grants Weaver 180 health and 0.9 health regeneration bonus."]}}

She well understands the suffering of the natural world. She has wandered far, and fared through forests bright and drear, in every clime and every season, gathering friends, sharing news, bringing laughter and healing wherever she goes. For in worlds wracked by war, forests are leveled for the building of ships and siege engines; and even in places of peace, the woods are stripped for the building of homes, and as fuel for countless hearths. Aiushtha hears the pleas of the small creatures, the furtive folk who need green shade and a leafy canopy to thrive. She lends her ears to those who have no other listeners. She carries their stories from the wood to the world, believing that her own good cheer is a kind of enchantment, that can itself fulfill the promise of a verdant future.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+6.5% Impetus Damage","talent_left":"+20 Nature's Attendants Heal"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+65 Untouchable Slow","talent_left":"Enchant Affects Ancients"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+45 Damage","talent_left":"+5 Nature's Attendants Wisps"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+10% Magic Resistance","talent_left":"+30 Movement Speed during Nature's Attendants"}],"notes":["The magic resistance talent stacks multiplicatively with other sources of magic resistance.

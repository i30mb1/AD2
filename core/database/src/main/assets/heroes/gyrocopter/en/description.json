The world's first non-magical flying device took over a decade to create, and less than a few seconds to shoot down. But its pilot was not deterred. Aurel returned to the skies in a newer, better Gyrocopter. Armed with Flak Cannons, the Gyrocopter can attack while traveling and mow down entire fields of foes even at distance greater than the reach of the main guns. Against targets that manage to escape the reach of the cannons, the contraption is equipped with self-regulating Homing Missiles that can tail their targets to the end of the world if not shot down. With a flick of a single button, a seemingly endless Barrage of Rockets can be released on anyone stepping too close to the flying machine. As the Keen he is, Aurel went overboard and mounted two huge rocket launchers on the back of the alerady loaded construction, allowing him to Call Down an air strike to devastate entire sectors.  Carry Nuker Disabler ","trivia":["Aurel Vlaicu was a Romanian pioneer of early flight."],"history":"After serving through a lifetime of wars, upheaval, riots, and revolutions, the brass figured Aurel had seen enough. But in addition to a few trinkets and his considerable pension, the erstwhile engineer left with something far more interesting: a long-forgotten, incomplete schematic for a Gyrocopter, the world's first manned, non-magical flying device. Retiring to the tropical obscurity of the Ash Archipelago with little else but time and money, he set to work building the device. As the years wore on and the remains of failed prototypes began to pile up, he began to wonder if mechanical flight was even possible. A decade and a day after his retirement, on a sunny afternoon with a southerly breeze, Aurel sat in his latest attempt bristling with indignation and expectant failure. With a grunt of effort he pulled the ignition cord and covered his head, waiting for the inevitable explosion. However to his great surprise he began to lift and, following a few panicked adjustments, stabilize. Within an hour, he was ducking and weaving with the breeze, level with the gulls, and Aurel found himself filled with the breathless wonder of flight. As dusk settled in he set a course back to his workshop, but no sooner had he turned his craft when a cannonball tore through his tailfin. Disentangling himself from the wreckage, he swam toward the nearest piece of land in sight, and cursed to see the ship responsible for the cannonball collecting the debris. Days later, when Aurel returned to his workshop, he set to work on yet another gyrocopter, this one capable of carrying a much heavier, more dangerous payload.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-6s Flak Cannon Cooldown","talent_left":"3x Call Down"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+40 Flak Cannon Damage","talent_left":"+16 Rocket Barrage Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+0.4s Homing Missile Stun Duration","talent_left":"+3 Flak Cannon Attacks"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+30 Movement Speed during Rocket Barrage","talent_left":"+200 Health"}],"notes":["The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage."]}}

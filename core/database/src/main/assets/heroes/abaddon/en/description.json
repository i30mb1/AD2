Unlike the other scions of his house, Abaddon drank deeper than any from the prophetic vapors that flowed from the Font of Avernus. Now a being of unnatural powers, Abaddon stifles his foes by spreading the Curse of Avernus, and releases deathly double-edged Mist Coils to damage adversaries and heal allies. The black mist swirls around his compatriots, forming an Aphotic Shield that absorbs attacks before bursting in a wide radius. But the Font's greatest gift is revealed only in the desperation of battle. Bestowed with Borrowed Time, Abaddon charges the enemy ranks, riding down foes with his cursed blade, his health returning with each welcoming blow. For all that was meant to kill did nothing but make the Lord of Avernus even more formidable.

Each newborn of the cavernous House Avernus is bathed in the black mist, and by this baptism they are given an innate connection to the mystic energies of the land. They grow up believing themselves fierce protectors of their lineal traditions, the customs of the realm\u2014but what they really are protecting is the Font itself. And the motives of the mist are unclear. When the infant Abaddon was bathed in the Font, they say something went awry. In the child's eyes there flared a light of comprehension that startled all present and set the sacerdotes to whispering. He was raised with every expectation of following the path all scions of Avernus took\u2014to train in war, that in times of need he might lead the family's army in defense of the ancestral lands. But Abaddon was always one apart. Where others trained with weapons, he bent himself to meditation in the presence of the mist. He drank deep from the vapors that welled from the Font, learning to blend his spirit with the potency that flowed from far beneath the House; he became a creature of the black mist. There was bitterness within the House Avernus\u2014elders and young alike accusing him of neglecting his responsibilities. But all such accusations stopped when Abaddon rode into battle, and they saw how the powers of the mist had given him mastery over life and death beyond those of any lord the House had ever known.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-1 Curse of Avernus Attacks Required","talent_left":"400 AoE Mist Coil"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+100 Aphotic Shield Health","talent_left":"-8s Borrowed Time Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+65 Damage","talent_left":"+50 Mist Coil Heal\/Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+15% Curse of Avernus Movement Slow","talent_left":"+8 Strength"}],"notes":["The strength talent effectively grants Abaddon 160 health, 0.8 health regeneration, and 8 main attack damage bonus.","This attack damage talent is added as bonus attack damage.

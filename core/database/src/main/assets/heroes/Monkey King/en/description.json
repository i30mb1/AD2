    "Monkey King's name, lore and abilities are based on Sun Wukong, the legendary hero from the Chinese classic Journey to the West. In the novel, the Monkey King wields the Ruyi Jingu Bang, a flexible magical staff that can change size and length. The name for Mischief in Dota 2's Chinese client is \"Seventy-two Transformations\" (七十二变, Qī shí èr biàn), a reference from the novel to Sun Wukong's ability to change into numerous forms. This is referenced by his voice line, \u201CLycan\u2019s got one transformation, I\u2019ve got seventy-two.\u201D Wukong's Command is based on one of the Monkey King's magical powers from the novel. He creates clones of himself from his hair, which he pulls from the back of his head, and blows into the wind. In the novel he can fly on a cloud, called the Cloud Somersault technique. This is referenced by the names of his 6.80 beta abilities(Nimble Nimbus, Cloud Dance), the cloud riding effect added by Great Sage\u2019s Reckoning, and his voice line: \u201CWhere\u2019s my cloud?\u201D",

  "history": "For 500 years the mountain pressed down upon him, only his head free from the crushing weight of the stonewrought prison the elder gods had summoned to halt his childish rebellion. Moss grew along the lines of his exposed face, tufts of grass sprouted from his ears; his vision was framed in wildflowers reaching from the soil around his cheeks. Most thought him long dead, tormented by the gods for waging war against the heavens until naught but his legend survived. But, as the stories go, the Monkey King cannot die. So he waited. Until the gods came to offer a chance at absolution, he endured. And when they did come to name the price, Sun Wukong accepted their charge: he would accompany a young acolyte on a secret pilgrimage, protect him from demons and dangers of the road, and guide the man home in possession of a coveted relic. Do that, and humbly obey the human's commands in service to their holy mission, and Wukong would prove himself reformed. For a change, Sun Wukong fulfilled his oath to the gods with honor, and atoned for the sins of past insurrections. The acolyte, much learned in hardships, was returned to his home temple, relic in hand; and Wukong-finding himself for the first time in proper standing with any gods of consequence-was content for a short while to give up his old thirst for adventure and glory. But the Monkey King was born for mischief...and offending the gods never gets old.",

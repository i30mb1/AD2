He immobilizes enemies with Searing Chains, holding them in place against the scorching heat of his Flame Guard. Across the land, Xin's glowing likenesses stand silent guard.

Upon a dais in its sealed temple rests a topaz cauldron filled with ancient ash, remnants of a pyre for the warrior-poet Xin. For three generations, Xin taught his acolytes the Bonds of the Guardian Flame, a series of mantras to train the mind and body for the harsh realities beyond the fortress walls. However, in teaching a warrior's way he earned a warrior's rivals, and in his autumn Xin was bested and slain. His followers spread to the wind. Yet as years turned to centuries and followers to descendants, his teachings endured by subtle whisper and deed. Touched by the teacher's lasting legacy, the Burning Celestial, inquisitive aspect of fire, cast himself to the Fortress of Flares and reignited the pyre ash. From these glowing embers emerged an image of Xin, wreathed in flame, his thoughtful countenance prepared to train and to teach, and to spread the fires of knowledge to all who seek guidance.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"2 Sleight of Fist Charges","talent_left":"-12s Remnant Charge Restore Time"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+1 Searing Chains Target","talent_left":"+65 Sleight of Fist Hero Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+50 Flame Guard DPS","talent_left":"+1s Searing Chains"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+15 Damage","talent_left":"+200 Flame Guard Absorption"}],"notes":["This attack damage talent is added as bonus attack damage.

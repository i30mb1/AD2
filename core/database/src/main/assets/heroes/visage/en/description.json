Perched atop the Narrow Maze was Visage, a dreadful gargoyle form to which the eternal spirit Necro'lic was bound. Tasked with hunting down those who escape the afterlife, Visage instills Grave Chill in his prey, impairing them while augmenting his speed. He reaps their essence with Soul Assumption, gathering energy from the anguish they felt before releasing it in a devastating attack. Protected by the Gravekeeper's Cloak, the gargoyle's ablative layers deflect both steel and spells. His deadly Familiars scout the land for runaways as Silent as the Grave. On his command, they harass their prey, dropping down to earth as Stone Statues to restrain the captive for their master's impending arrival.  Support Nuker Durable Disabler Pusher ","trivia":["Visage has one of the most numerous ability remakes in the game, with Grave Chill being his only mainstay: Soul Assumption, in an earlier version, was an autocast enabled attack modifier where he will deal bonus damage and steal the life of his enemies upon death, healing him and leaving no corpse. Gravekeeper's Cloak used to be a passive aura where allies in the area will be healed when Visage takes damage, physical or magical. Raise Revenants, his former ultimate, lets him summon up to eight pitch-black, gargoyle-shaped spirits from a corpse. It was likely changed because of it being a very effective scouting tool that makes map control easier. The Revenants had good vision range, a flying attribute, and can be resummoned easily since the ability neither cost a lot of mana nor had a long cooldown. This, along with the fact that the Revenants did not do a lot of damage on their own (attack modifier limits their damage to one-third the stated amount against heroes) and no special abilities give them very limited usage in combat situations.","Soul Assumption, in an earlier version, was an autocast enabled attack modifier where he will deal bonus damage and steal the life of his enemies upon death, healing him and leaving no corpse.","Gravekeeper's Cloak used to be a passive aura where allies in the area will be healed when Visage takes damage, physical or magical.","Raise Revenants, his former ultimate, lets him summon up to eight pitch-black, gargoyle-shaped spirits from a corpse.

Beasts and birds, men and monsters, all creatures that die and choose to travel beyond must someday pass beneath their sight. For an untethered spirit, the decision to journey through the veil of death is irrevocable. When chance comes, and by craft or cunning some restless soul escapes their hells and heavens, it is the dreaded gargoyle Visage, the bound form of the eternal spirit Necro\u2019lic, who is dispatched to reclaim them. Ruthless and efficient, unhindered by the principles of death and fatigue, Visage stalks its prey without mercy or end, willingly destroying all which may give shelter to the fugitive essence. That which flaunts the laws of the afterlife may never rest, for while it is true that the dead may be revived, it is only a matter of time before Visage finds and returns them to their proper place.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Gravekeeper's Cloak grants +10 Armor","talent_left":"+1 Familiar"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+20 Soul Assumption Damage Per Charge","talent_left":"+20 Visage and Familiars Movement Speed"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-1 Armor Corruption to Visage and Familiars","talent_left":"Soul Assumption Hits 2 Targets"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"-3s Grave Chill Cooldown","talent_left":"+6 Visage and Familiars Attack Damage"}]}}

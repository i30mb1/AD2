He is utterly loyal, and his taciturn nature hides deep knowledge of the most secret places of the sea. He rises to the shallows in spite of the pain caused him by brightness, to commit reconnaissance, to make sure no one is conspiring against the depths, and sometimes in relentless pursuit of the rare few who manage to steal off with an item from the Sunken Treasury. Because he has spent his whole life at great pressure, under tremendous weight of the sea, Slardar the Slithereen Guard is a creature of immense power.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-4s Slithereen Crush Cooldown","talent_left":"Corrosive Haze Undispellable"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+150 Slithereen Crush Damage","talent_left":"-4 Corrosive Haze Armor"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+325 Health","talent_left":"+50 Bash Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"-3s Guardian Sprint Cooldown","talent_left":"+0.2s Slithereen Crush Stun Duration"}],"notes":["The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage."]}}

That's because children don't know that most fairies are spiteful jerks. And in the world of spiteful fairies there are few names spoken of with more contempt than Mireska Sunbreeze.

But while she was quite adept at navigating the etiquette, unspoken laws, and social rituals that permeated every element of her life, she found the whole thing rather boring. So, Mireska did what most rebellious children do: burn down her family estate and set off with her pet wisp Jex to live the life of a wandering grifter.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+100 Attack Speed","talent_left":"Bedlam Pierces Spell Immunity"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+2s Shadow Realm Duration","talent_left":"-7s Bramble Maze CD"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+30 Bedlam Damage","talent_left":"+160 Cursed Crown AoE"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+0.5s Cursed Crown Stun Duration","talent_left":"-2s Shadow Realm Cooldown"}]}}

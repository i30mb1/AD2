In the endless pursuit of rare texts, Demnok Lannik found it necessary to learn the magics that would help him reach the most inaccessible tomes. In short time, his obsessive study made him the most powerful Warlock in the academy. As he whispers a versatile Shadow Word to heal fellow adventurers, or damage hostile creatures. Binding his foes together with Fatal Bonds forcing them to share their agony. Demnok Lannik brings a Chaotic Offering to every fight.

No cursed temple was so foreboding, no cavern path so treacherous, that any concern for his own survival could dissuade him from entering if rumors hinted that some pamphlet of primordial lore might still survive in its depths. However, so often did his investigations trigger the wrath of protector entities, that he finally found it necessary to master the arts of magic. He bent himself to learning sorcery with the same thorough obsessiveness that marked his quest for incunabula, becoming the most powerful Warlock of the Academy in less time than most practitioners required to complete a course of undergraduate work. Almost as an afterthought, he carved a staff of Dreadwood and summoned into it a captive spirit from the Outer Hells. And anticipating the day when he will have recovered every last lost spellbook, he has commenced writing his own Black Grimoire. It will undoubtedly be instructive.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+20 Chaotic Offering Golems Armor","talent_left":"80% Magic Resistance for Chaotic Offering Golems"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"Summons a Golem on Death","talent_left":"+25 Shadow Word Damage\/Heal"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+12s Upheaval Attack Speed per second on Allies","talent_left":"-4s Shadow Word Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+3% Fatal Bonds Damage","talent_left":"+75 Upheaval Radius"}]}}

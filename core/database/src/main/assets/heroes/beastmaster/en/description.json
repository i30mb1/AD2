Raised in the royal menagerie of Slom, Karroch learned to converse with beasts from a young age. With this unique talent, the Beastmaster is able to summon to his side a trusty poison-spitting Boar and a scouting Hawk. In addition to his companions, Karroch has mastered the art of throwing Wild Axes, cutting down trees and foes before returning to his hands. The Beastmaster awakens the Inner Beast of nearby allies, increasing their attack speed. Should an enemy attempt to flee, Karroch lets loose a piercing Primal Roar, incapacitating the target and clearing the path to its demise.

His mother died in childbirth; his father, a farrier for the Last King of Slom, was trampled to death when he was five. Afterward Karroch was indentured to the king's menagerie, where he grew up among all the beasts of the royal court: lions, apes, fell-deer, and things less known, things barely believed in. When the lad was seven, an explorer brought in a beast like none before seen. Dragged before the King in chains, the beast spoke, though its mouth moved not. Its words: a plea for freedom. The King only laughed and ordered the beast perform for his amusement; and when it refused, struck it with the Mad Scepter and ordered it dragged to the stocks. Over the coming months, the boy Karroch sneaked food and medicinal draughts to the wounded creature, but only managed to slow its deterioration. Wordlessly, the beast spoke to the boy, and over time their bond strengthened until the boy found he could hold up his end of a conversation. He could, in fact, speak now to all the creatures of the King's menagerie. On the night the beast died, a rage came over the boy. He incited the animals of the court to rebel and threw open their cages to set them amok on the palace grounds. The Last King was mauled in the mayhem. In the chaos, one regal stag bowed to the boy who had freed him; and with Beastmaster astride him, leapt the high walls of the estate, and escaped. Now a man, Karroch the Beastmaster has not lost his ability to converse with wild creatures. He has grown into a warrior at one with nature's savagery.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-5 Wild Axes Cooldown","talent_left":"-30s Primal Roar Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+35 Boar Damage","talent_left":"+250 Health Beastmaster Controlled"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+25 Movespeed Beastmaster Controlled","talent_left":"+10 Inner Beast Attack Speed"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+30 Damage","talent_left":"+2.5% Wild Axes Damage Amp Per Stack"}],"notes":["The health talent is provided by an aura.","The movement speed talent is provided by an aura.","This attack damage talent is added as bonus attack damage.

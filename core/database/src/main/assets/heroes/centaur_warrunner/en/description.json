Some write to express their being, others paint or sing. But for the centaurs of Druud, there is no higher art than the art of killing. And in that, none was more accomplished than Bradwarden. With skills acquired in the arena, the Warrunner punishes his opponents and instantly Retaliates their every attack, disregarding harm to himself as he metes out a fearsome Double Edge. Ever in search of a worthy opponent, Bradwarden rouses his allies, and sometimes Hitching them on his back for a ride, to charge down enemies in a wild Stampede, quickening the pace of the carnage. Once battle is joined, the Centaur Warrunner Stomps and tramples surrounding foes, stunning them just long enough for his battleaxe to sink in.  Durable Initiator Disabler Nuker Escape ","trivia":["In DotA, Bradwarden's hero title was Centaur Warchief."],"history":"It's said that a centaur's road is paved with the corpses of the fallen. For the one called Warrunner, it has been a long road indeed. To outsiders, the four-legged clans of Druud are often mistaken for simple, brutish creatures. Their language has no written form; their culture lacks pictographic traditions, structured music, formalized religion. For centaurs, combat is the perfect articulation of thought, the highest expression of self. If killing is an art among centaurs, then Bradwarden the Warrunner is their greatest artist. He rose to dominance on the proving grounds of Omexe, an ancient arena where centaur clans have for millennia gathered to perform their gladiatorial rites. As his fame spread, spectators came from far and wide to see the great centaur in action. Always the first to step into the arena, and the last to leave, he composes a masterpiece in each guttering spray, each thrust of blood-slickened blade-length. It is the poetry of blood on steel, flung in complex patterns across the pale sands of the killing floor. Warrunner defeated warrior after warrior, until the arena boomed with the cheering of his name, and he found himself alone, the uncontested champion of his kind. The great belt of Omexe was bestowed, wrapped around his broad torso, but in his victory, the death-artist found only emptiness. For what is a warrior without a challenge? The great centaur galloped out of Omexe that day with a new goal. To his people, Warrunner is the greatest warrior to ever step into the arena. Now he has set out to prove he is the greatest fighter who has ever lived.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Gains Retaliate Aura","talent_left":"+1s Hoof Stomp Duration"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+45 Retaliate Damage","talent_left":"-25s Stampede Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+15 Strength","talent_left":"+40% Double Edge Strength Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+5 Health Regen","talent_left":"+20 Movement Speed"}],"notes":["The strength talent effectively grants Centaur Warrunner 300 health, 1.5 health regeneration, and 15 main attack damage bonus."]}}

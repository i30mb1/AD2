With a single bullet, Kardel Sharpeye pierced the steep-stalker's central eye from the valley floor, an ominous act that resulted in his ritual exile. He would win acclaim on a field of battle, or never return. Like his mountain kin, the Sniper is one with his firearm. He Takes Aim from great distances, and scores Headshots that stop his targets dead. Armed with a modular rifle, Kardel launches incendiary rounds to rain burning Shrapnel or throwing a Grenade knocking back his enemies over entrenched positions. No enemy is safe within the range of the Sniper's scope. As he pauses to line up his cross-hairs, compensating for every variable before he Assassinates his mark in one fatal shot.

Sharpeye was among the best of these strange mountain keens for whom projectile weapons are but another appendage, and to shoot is as natural as to touch. On his day of summoning, when he was to gain full standing in his village, Sharpeye took the ancient test: a single shot from the valley floor to strike a beast down from the cliffs. To miss was to be dishonored. With his entire village standing vigil, Sharpeye took his shot. A steepstalker fell; the crowd cheered. But when the carcass was collected, the village grew silent, for the elders found that the bullet had pierced its glittering central eye then fallen to be clenched in the steepstalker's mandibles. This ominous sign was the literal opening of a dark prophecy, foretelling both greatness and exile for the gunman who made such a shot. Sharpeye the Sniper was thus, by his own skill, condemned to make his way apart from his people\u2014and unwelcome back among them until he has fulfilled the remainder of the prophecy by attaining legendary stature on a field of battle.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+100 Attack Range","talent_left":"+6 Shrapnel Charges"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+28 Knockback Distance Headshot","talent_left":"+24 Shrapnel DPS"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+30 Attack Speed","talent_left":"-14% Shrapnel Slow"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+1s Take Aim Duration","talent_left":"+30 Headshot Damage"}]}}

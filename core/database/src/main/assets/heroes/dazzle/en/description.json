A journey to the Nothl Realm changes all its visitors, not least of which Dazzle, a young acolyte of the Dezun Order. Consecrated as a Shadow Priest, Dazzle sends outs Shadow Waves to mend and maim. Foes are crippled by his paralytic enchantment \u2014 the Poison Touch, while allies are blessed with Shallow Graves, cheating death no matter how severe their injuries. As for himself, with each spell cast, each invocation of his strange Juju magic advances the efficiency of his spell-casting.

The final rite, the rite of shades, is a harrowing spiritual journey through the Nothl Realm, an unpredictable domain from which not all visitants return. Of those who do, some return mad. Others return with strange aptitudes. But all who go there are changed by their experiences. Driven by the need for enlightenment, Dazzle was the youngest of his tribe ever to request the sacred ritual. At first the order refused him, saying he was too young. But Dazzle was not to be dissuaded. Sensing something special in the headstrong young acolyte, the elders relented. Dazzle drank down the sacred potion and sat by the fire while the rest of his tribe danced through the night. In this ethereal dimension of the Nothl Realm, the properties of light and dark are inverted. Thus his brilliant healing light, beautiful to our eye, is actually a sinister kind of evil; and the darkest deeds are done in a dazzling glow. The elders' intuition was prophetic: Dazzle returned to his people as a Shadow Priest like none seen before, with the power to heal as well as to destroy. Now he uses his gift to cut down his enemies and mend his friends.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-40% Poison Touch Slow","talent_left":"+0.5 Bad Juju Armor Reduction"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+200 Heal On Shallow Grave End","talent_left":"+45 Poison Touch DPS"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+45 Shadow Wave Heal \/ Damage","talent_left":"+350 Poison Touch Attack Range"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+50 Damage","talent_left":"+1.75 Mana Regen"}],"notes":["This attack damage talent is added as bonus attack damage.

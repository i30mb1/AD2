Bending the laws of nature itself, Lanaya forms a Refraction field that absorbs incoming blows, yet amplifies outgoing attacks. She Melds into the background, lying in ambush to unleash a burst of psionic energy on unsuspecting targets. Violet light emanates from her fingertips, her Psi Blades out-ranges any melee weapon, shreds and pierce through lines of foes at once. Persistent in her goals, Lanaya marks the ground with magic circles of eldritch design. Those who walk unknowingly over a Psionic Trap can only limp away from the explosion \u2014 for their presence has been revealed, and the assassin who Projected herself into place is not far behind.  Carry Escape ","trivia":["In DotA, Templar Assassin makes numerous references to the game \"Starcraft\", another famous RTS game by \"Blizzard\". Her ability to manipulate psionic energy, the Psi Blades she wields, and the mention of her master being originally from Aiur in her DotA biography all apply to the Protoss, one of the three main races of the game. The description of Meld also describes it as the \"Art of Shakuras\". In \"Starcraft\" lore Shakuras is the capital of the Lenassa clan which is part of the Nerazim faction better known as Dark Templar. Lenassa templars are wearing cloth shrouds on their faces, and have purple warp blades and purple eyes.[1]"],"history":"Lanaya, the Templar Assassin, came to her calling by a path of curious inquiry. Possessed of a scientific bent, she spent her early years engaged in meticulous study of nature's laws--peering into grimoires of magic and alchemy, recreating experiments from charred fragments of the Violet Archives, and memorizing observations of the Keen recordkeepers. Already quiet and secretive by nature, the difficulty of acquiring these objects further reinforced her skills of stealth. Had she been less retiring, she might have become notorious among the guilds as a thief-scholar. Instead her investigations led her into far more obscure corners. As she devoted her furtive talents to unlocking the secrets of the universe, she instead unlocked a secret door that exists in nature itself: the entryway to the most Hidden Temple. The intelligences that waited beyond that portal, proved to be expecting her, and whatever mysteries they revealed in the moment of their discovery was nothing compared to the answers they held out to Lanaya should she continue in their service. She swore to protect the mysteries, but more to the point, in service to the Hidden Temple she satisfies her endless craving for understanding. In the eyes of each foe she expunges, a bit more of the mystery is revealed.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"1s Meld Hit Bash","talent_left":"+7 Refraction Instances"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"Meld Dispels","talent_left":"-3 Meld Armor Reduction"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"Refraction Can Be Cast While Disabled","talent_left":"+120 Psi Blades Attack and Spill Range"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+25 Refraction Attack Damage","talent_left":"+110 Psionic Trap Damage"}]}}

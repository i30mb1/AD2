Wings branded and visage twisted, the Fallen One bears little resemblance to his former self. Banished from the realm of light, Lucifer now walks the earth, bringing misery to all who stand against him. The towering demon Devours creeps in a single bite, digesting them whole and assimilating their abilities. The fires of Hell smolder at Lucifer's feet, leaving in his wake fields of Scorched Earth. When the bell of Vashundol tolls, an enemy's downfall is sure to follow. Raising his Infernal Blade, Lucifer places upon his adversary an enduring curse, burning away at its health and rendering it utterly powerless as it staggers towards its inevitable Doom.

Bearing away souls on the tip of a fiery sword, he is the Fallen One, a once-favored general from the realm behind the light, cast out for the sin of defiance: he would not kneel. Six times his name was tolled from the great bell of Vashundol. Six and sixty times his wings were branded, until only smoking stumps remained. Without wings, he slipped loose from the tethers that bound him within the light and he fell screaming to earth. A crater in the desert, Paradise lost. Now he attacks without mercy, without motive, the only living being able to move freely between the seven dark dominions. Lashed by inescapable needs, twisted by unimaginable talents, Doom carries his own hell with him wherever he goes. Defiant to the last. Eventually, the world will belong to Doom.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+2.1% Infernal Blade Damage","talent_left":"Doom Applies Break"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"-12s Scorched Earth Cooldown","talent_left":"-35s Doom Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+10% Scorched Earth Movement Speed","talent_left":"Devour Can Target Ancients"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"Devour grants 15% Magic Resistance","talent_left":"+20 Scorched Earth Damage"}]}}

The phenomenon that is Io manifests on the physical plane as a wisp of light, its purpose beyond mortal understanding. Accompanied by complementary Spirits that roam around the wisp at its will, it flits to and fro the battlefield, searching for an ally to Tether to. Those blessed with Io's bond feel their feet lighten as the Wisp channels its own regenerative powers into their body. Should its host falter, Io begins to Overcharge, augmenting that ally's speed while strengthening his resolve. As a force unbound by the laws of corporeal space, Io is able to temporarily Relocate itself and an ally to any point in the world, often saving a companion from certain death.

Like the great twin riders Dark and Light, and yet another ancient traveler whose true history is lost to the ages, Io the Wisp is a Fundamental of the universe, a force older than time, a wanderer from realms far beyond mortal understanding. Io is nothing less than the sum of all attractive and repulsive forces within the material field, a sentient manifestation of the charge that bind existence together. It is only in the controlled warping of these electrical waylines that Io's presence can be experienced on the physical plane. A benevolent, cooperative force, Io bonds its strange magnetism to others so that the power of allies might be enhanced. Its motives inscrutable, its strength unimaginable, Io moves through the physical plane, the perfect expression of the mysteries of the universe.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+400 Health to Tethered Units","talent_left":"Attack Tethered Ally's Target"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+0.2% Overcharge Max HP Regen Bonus","talent_left":"-25s Relocate Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+6% Tether Movement Speed","talent_left":"+55 Spirits Hero Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+15% Tether Move\/Attack Slow","talent_left":"+15 Attack Damage to Tethered Units"}]}}

        "Tethering a unit that is 700 units or further away causes Io to latch on and pull itself to the target. Pulls Io at a speed of 1000, until coming within 300 range of the target. Can pull Io over impassable terrain and through trees. Destroys trees within 150 radius around Io once the pull ends. If Io breaks the tether while getting pulled to the tethered target, the pull immediately stops. The pull gets interrupted when Io gets stunned, hexed, hidden, feared, hypnotized, or rooted during the pull. Forced movement sources cancel the pull as well, but only after the movement ends, and not upon getting applied. Taunts, leashes, and silences do not interrupt the pulling. If the distance between Io and the target gets greater than 2150 during the pull, the pull ends, and the Tether breaks",
        "If the distance between Io and the target gets greater than 1000, the Tether breaks. When the distance between Io and the tethered target gets greater than 700, the link's visual appearance changes. The link changes color at 700 distance and jiggles at 800 distance",

Sets Io's base movement speed is equal to the base speed of the target, plus any speed bonuses they have, flat and percentage. Since it sets Io's base movement speed, percentage-based movement speed bonuses and slows are based on this value during Tether. Fully overrides any flat movement speed bonuses and reductions on Io, from items and abilities alike. If the target is slowed, the slow is not copied by Io. Tether copies the target's movement speed as if they are not slowed. Does not copy the target's movement speed while Io is hasted. While tethered, Io cannot bypass the maximum movement speed limit, even if the tethered ally does. Prevents other abilities from unlocking the movement speed limit as well (e.g.  Force Boots,  Thirst)",
        "The tethered unit benefits from  Overcharge,  Relocate, and from Io regenerating or replenishing health and mana. Tethered units still benefit from all those effects even when turning invulnerable or hidden. The heal and mana restore transfer happens regardless of how much Io actually healed or restored. The health\/mana transfer percent is applied after all reductions and amplifications on Io",

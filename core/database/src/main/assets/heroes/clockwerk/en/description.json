Powered by revenge and ingenuity, Rattletrap armored himself into an instrument of war. Firing Rockets from his shoulder-mounted launcher, striking and revealing distant territories. With a built-in Jetpack for scouting convenience, a sudden Hookshot flies, latching instantly and pulling the mechanized Keen to his unsuspecting foe. Before the stunned target could react, Rattletrap erects a grid of Power Cogs, isolating and trapping his foe within while repelling help from without. He triggers the suit's Battery Assault, and watches the target panic as short bursts of shrapnel whittle down its remaining health... and if all that was not enough, Overclocking the armored suit and repeating the assault at higher speeds may do the trick.

The son of the son of a clockmaker, Rattletrap was many years apprenticed to that trade before war rode down from the mountains and swept the plains villages free of such innocent vocations. \"Your new trade is battle,\" his dying father told him as the village of their ancestors lay in charred and smoking ruins. It is a poor tradesman who blames his tools, and Rattletrap was never one to make excuses. After burying his father among the ruins of their village, he set about to transform himself into the greatest tool of warfare that any world had ever seen. He vowed to never again be caught unprepared, instead using his talents to assemble a suit of powered Clockwerk armor to make the knights of other lands look like tin cans by comparison. Now Rattletrap is alive with devices, a small but deadly warrior whose skills at ambush and destruction have risen to near-automated levels of efficiency. An artisan of death, his mechanizations make short work of the unwary, heralding a new dawn in this age of warfare. What time is it? It's Clockwerk time!","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Spell Immunity Inside Power Cogs","talent_left":"-0.25s Battery Assault Interval"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"Rocket Flare True Sight","talent_left":"Power Cogs Leash Units Inside"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+2 Power Cogs Hit To Kill","talent_left":"+24 Battery Assault Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"-2s Rocket Flare Cooldown","talent_left":"-2s Power Cogs Cooldown"}]}}

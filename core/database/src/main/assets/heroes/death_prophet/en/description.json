But after years of inquiring on behalf of others, she began to seek clues on her own fate. When death refused to yield its secrets, she tried to buy them with her life. But the ultimate price proved insufficient. Death disgorged her again and again, always holding back its deepest mysteries. Her jealousy grew. Others could die for eternity\u2014why not she? Why must she alone be cast back on the shores of life with such tiresome regularity? Why was she not worthy of the one thing all other living creatures took for granted? Still, she would not be discouraged. Each time she returned from the grave, she brought a bit of death back with her. Wraiths followed her like fragments of her shattered soul; her blood grew thin and ectoplasmic; the feasting creatures of twilight took her for their kin.. She gave a little of her life with every demise, and it began to seem as if her end was in sight. With her dedication to death redoubled, and no client other than herself, Krobelus threw herself ever more fervently into death's abyss, intent on fulfilling the one prophecy that eluded her: That someday the Death Prophet would return from death no more.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-20s Spirit Siphon Replenish Time","talent_left":"+8 Exorcism Spirits"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"-20% Spirit Siphon Move Speed Slow","talent_left":"+400 Health"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+30 Spirit Siphon Damage\/Heal","talent_left":"-2s Crypt Swarm Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+30 Damage","talent_left":"+14% Magic Resistance"}],"notes":["The magic resistance talent stacks multiplicatively with other sources of magic resistance.

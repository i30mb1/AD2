While her normal spectral state transcends sensory limitations, each time she takes on a physical manifestation, she is stricken by a loss of self--though not of purpose. In the clash of combat, her identity shatters and reconfigures, and she begins to regain awareness. She grasps that she is Mercurial the Spectre--and that all of her Haunts are but shadows of the one true Spectre. Focus comes in the struggle for survival; her true mind reasserts itself; until in the final moments of victory or defeat, she transcends matter and is restored once more to her eternal form.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+32% Haunt Illusion Damage","talent_left":"+5% Dispersion"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+350 Health","talent_left":"+12% Spectral Dagger Slow\/Bonus"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+12 Desolate Damage","talent_left":"+100 Spectral Dagger Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"-4s Spectral Dagger Cooldown","talent_left":"+5 All Stats"}],"notes":["The \/ \/ all stats talent effectively grants Spectre 100 health, 0.5 health regeneration, 0.83 main armor, 5 attack speed, 60 mana, 0.25 mana regeneration, and 5 main attack damage bonus.","The health talent increases maximum health capacity, and keeps the current health percentage."]}}

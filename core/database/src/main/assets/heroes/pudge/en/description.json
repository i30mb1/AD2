Each carefully aimed throw of Pudge's signature Meat Hook strikes fear into his foes. Disoriented, his foe stumbles, gagging on a sudden stench of Rot. As it looks up at the fleshy hulk, hoping for an answer, only to watch as the Butcher Dismembers and carves them with his cleavers, adding a layer to his compost Heap.

In this cursed realm, nothing can decay or decompose; no corpse may ever return to the earth from which it sprang, no matter how deep you dig the grave. Flocked by carrion birds who need him to cut their meals into beak-sized chunks, Pudge the Butcher hones his skills with blades that grow sharper the longer he uses them. Swish, swish, thunk. Flesh falls from the bone; tendons and ligaments part like wet paper. And while he always had a taste for the butchery, over the ages, Pudge has developed a taste for its byproduct as well. Starting with a gobbet of muscle here, a sip of blood there...before long he was thrusting his jaws deep into the toughest of torsos, like a dog gnawing at rags. Even those who are beyond fearing the Reaper, fear the Butcher.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"1.8x Dismember Damage\/Heal","talent_left":"1.5x Flesh Heap Stack Str and Damage Block bonuses"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+0.8s Dismember Duration","talent_left":"-4s Meat Hook Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"8% Spell Lifesteal","talent_left":"+120 Meat Hook Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+4 Armor","talent_left":"-16% Rot Slow"}],"notes":["The armor talent does not benefit illusions.","The spell lifesteal talent stacks additively with other sources of spell lifesteal.

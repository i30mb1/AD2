  "description": "Mows down her enemies with heavy artillery and trusty lizard. The plucky Keen known as Beatrix Snapfire has survived to venerable old age in the harsh deserts of Nanarak, owing to her ingenious craftsmanship, and overwhelming firepower. Just as happy to blow your legs off with her Trusty Scattergun as to fill your belly up with a deliciously-dangerous Firesnap Cookie, she delights in riding into battle with her dragon toad Mortimer, always ready to mow down their enemies with her Lil' Shredder, a homemade heavy artillery, or finish them off with a surprise \u2014 a steady, long range artillery barrage of Mortimer's Kisses and sometimes an ally Mortimer Gobbled Up, covering the battlefield in pools of flame.

    "Snapfire's response \" Link▶️ This here's my boomstick\" is a reference to Ash's line from Army of Darkness.",
    "Snapfire's response \" Link▶️ I love the smell of black powder in the morning\" is a reference to Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore's line from Apocalypse Now .",
    "Snapfire's response \" Link▶️ Oh give me a home, where the wildwings roam...\" is a reference to the Western folk song Home on the Range.",

  "history": "Beatrix Snapfire and her dragon toad Mortimer are a welcome sight to the ragged folk who scratch out lives along the desert routes and oases scattered throughout Nanarak, the rain-forsaken gateway to the Outlands. As well known for her unrivaled skills as a weaponsmith as for dispensing wisdom, mirth, and the meanest firesnap cookies the world has ever seen, Beadie's survived to a ripe old age in a young keen's trade by being quick with her wits and even quicker with her guns. Indeed, the Outlands are littered with the bones of bandits and ne'er-do-wells who thought to take advantage of her small stature and propensity for kindness.",

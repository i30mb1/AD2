Venomancer brings slow death to its enemies. It infects other living beings by its very touch, and spewed Venomous Gales to slow and poison escaping prey. Part reptile and part orchid, it sprouts an endless army of toxin-spitting sentinels, the Plague Wards, to defend its perimeters with Acid Spit.

Yet even in this toxic menagerie, Venomancer is acknowledged as the most venomous. Ages ago, an Herbalist named Lesale crossed the Bay of Fradj by coracle, searching for potent essences that might be extracted from bark and root, and found instead a nightmare transformation. Two leagues into Jidi's jungle, Lesale encountered a reptile camouflaged as an epiphyte, which stung him as he mistakenly plucked it. In desperation, he used his partial knowledge of the jungle's herbal bounty, mixing the venom of the (swiftly throttled) reptile with the nectar of an armored orchid, to compound an antidote. In the moments before a black paralysis claimed him completely, he injected himself by orchid-thorn, and instantly fell into a coma. Seventeen years later, something stirred in the spot where he had fallen, throwing off the years' accumulation of humus: Venomancer. Lesale the Herbalist no longer\u2014but Lesale the Deathbringer. His mind was all but erased, and his flesh had been consumed and replaced by a new type of matter\u2014one fusing the venom of the reptile with the poisonous integument of the orchid. Jidi's Acid Jungles knew a new master, one before whom even the most vicious predators soon learned to bow or burrow for their lives. The lurid isle proved too confining, and some human hunger deep in the heart of the Venomancer drove Lesale out in search of new poisons\u2014and new deaths to bring.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Poison Nova reduces 100 Attack Speed","talent_left":"2.5x Plague Ward HP\/Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+5s Poison Nova Duration","talent_left":"Gale Creates Plague Wards"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-1s Plague Ward Cooldown","talent_left":"+8% Poison Sting Slow"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"-5 Venomous Gale CD","talent_left":"+20% Poison Sting Health Regen Reduction"}]}}

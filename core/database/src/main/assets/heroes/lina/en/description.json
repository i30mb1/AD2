Like her younger sister, Lina's elemental affinity was the source of many headaches. Sent south to live with a patient aunt, she learned to master her Fiery Soul in the blazing Desert of Misrule. Channeling the breath of Desert Wyrms, she unleashes her Dragon Slave to burn a path before her. Attuned to fire, Lina ignites the ground, incinerating foes in a Column of Flame. Even the hardiest of heroes fear the Slayer's signature spell \u2014 The Laguna Blade. Focusing every bit of heat around her, and Cloaking Herself in Flames, Lina fires a condensed bolt of white-hot energy, instantly evaporating her opponent with minimal struggle or effort.

Lina always had the advantage, however, for while Crystal was guileless and naive, Lina's fiery ardor was tempered by cleverness and conniving. The exasperated parents of these incompatible offspring went through half a dozen homesteads, losing one to fire, the next to ice, before they realized life would be simpler if the children were separated. As the oldest, Lina was sent far south to live with a patient aunt in the blazing Desert of Misrule, a climate that proved more than comfortable for the fiery Slayer. Her arrival made quite an impression on the somnolent locals, and more than one would-be suitor scorched his fingers or went away with singed eyebrows, his advances spurned. Lina is proud and confident, and nothing can dampen her flame.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-25s Laguna Blade Cooldown","talent_left":"Laguna Blade damage is Pure and pierces Spell Immunity"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+11% Spell Amplification","talent_left":"+15\/1% Fiery Soul Per Stack"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+350 Health","talent_left":"+130 Light Strike Array Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+20 Damage","talent_left":"-3.5s Dragon Slave Cooldown"}],"notes":["This attack damage talent is added as bonus attack damage.

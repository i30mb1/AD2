This element is seen\/represented as the top point of a pentagram, a symbol sometimes misused as one of evil (there is no Devil-esque figure in Paganism), and could have been intended to show or derive from Queen of Pain's sadistic nature. The Doom ability icon is a regular pentagram, so it might be a misconception held by the DotA staff and the reasoning for her name. A regular pentagram on someone, ignoring misconceptions, is actually protective. The name Aether is one of the many references Dota 2 makes to Greek mythology, as it is derived from a Greek deity of the same name. Akasha is also the name of the Queen of the Damned from Anne Rice's \"Vampire Chronicles\" novel series, which could have inspired Queen of Pain's name, who, in turn, could have derived her name from the above roots.","This element is seen\/represented as the top point of a pentagram, a symbol sometimes misused as one of evil (there is no Devil-esque figure in Paganism), and could have been intended to show or derive from Queen of Pain's sadistic nature.

In a less prominent political figure, such desires might be considered unwise, but in a monarch of his stature, to satisfy such thirsts would have threatened the virtue of the Divine Throne itself. Therefore he turned to his dungeon full of demonologists, promising freedom to whoever could summon a personal succubus of torment and bind it entirely to his service. The creature who arrived, Akasha by name, visited upon him such exquisite torments that he named her his Secret Queen, and he began to spend all his spare moments submitting to her clever torments\u2014eventually abdicating all his responsibilities in his pursuit of the painful pleasures that only she could bring. Queen of Pain could bring him to the brink of death, but she was rune-bound to keep him alive. At last the King's neglect of state brought on an uprising. He was dragged from his chamber and hurled from the Tower of Invocations, and at the moment of death, Queen of Pain was let loose into the world, freed from servitude\u2014freed to visit her sufferings on anyone she deigned to notice.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-2s Blink Cooldown","talent_left":"+200 Sonic Wave Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+120 Scream of Pain Damage","talent_left":"-40s Sonic Wave Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-0.7s Shadow Strike Damage Interval","talent_left":"+30 Attack Speed"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+20 Damage","talent_left":"+11 Strength"}],"notes":["The strength talent effectively grants Queen of Pain 220 health and 1.1 health regeneration bonus.","This attack damage talent is added as bonus attack damage.

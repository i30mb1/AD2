protects and heals his allies. A guardian at the front lines of battle whose mere presence Degenerates those of lesser faith, Omniknight is always eager to join his team in battle. Whether healing an ally with Purifying lights that also harm nearby foes, protecting his allies with the All Seeing One's Heavenly Grace, or battering an enemy with his Mighty Hammer. In decisive moments of battle, he calls forth the Guardian Angel, granting himself and nearby allies total physical immunity, nullifying the enemies' attacks for a short time.  Support Durable Nuker ","trivia":["Some parts of Omniknight's bio are a reference to the bible story of Daniel in the Lion's Pit. Daniel was thrown into the lion's den for praying to God and challenging Darius' command not to do so, but God prevented the lions from harming Daniel, saving his life. Similarly, Omniknight was to be thrown to the pit of sacrifice for challenging his priests but the Omniscience revealed itself, saving Purist."],"history":"Purist Thunderwrath was a hard-fighting, road-worn, deeply committed knight, sworn to the order in which he had grown up as squire to elder knights of great reputation. He had spent his entire life in the service of the Omniscience, the All Seeing One. Theirs was a holy struggle, and so embedded was he in his duty that he never questioned it so long as he had the strength to fight and the impetuous valor that comes with youth. But over the long years of the crusade, as his elders passed away and were buried in sorry graves at the side of muddy tracks, as his bond-brothers fell in battle to uncouth creatures that refused to bow to the Omniscience, as his own squires were chewed away by ambush and plague and bad water, he began to question the meaning of his vows--the meaning of the whole crusade. After deep meditation, he parted ways with his army and commenced a long trek back to the cave-riddled cliffs of Emauracus, and there he set a challenge to the priests of the Omniscience. No knight had ever questioned them before, and they tried to throw him into the pit of sacrifice, but Purist would not be moved. For as he faced them down, he began to glow with a holy light, and they saw that the Omniscience had chosen to reveal Itself to him. The Elder Hierophant led him on a journey of weeks down into the deepest chamber, the holy of holies, where waited not some abstract concept of wisdom and insight, not some carved relic requiring an injection of imagination to believe in, but the old one itself. It had not merely dwelt in those rocks for billions of aeons; no, It had created them. The Omniscience had formed the immense mineral shell of the planet around itself, as a defense against the numerous terrors of space. Thus the All Seeing One claimed to have created the world, and given the other truths revealed to Purist on that day, the knight had no reason to refute the story. Perhaps the Omniscience is a liar, deep in its prison of stone, and not the world's creator at all, but Omniknight never again questioned his faith. His campaign had meaning at last. And there can be no question that the glorious powers that imbue him, and give his companions such strength in battle, are real beyond any doubt.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+160 Purification Damage\/Heal","talent_left":"+75% Hammer of Purity Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+3 Heavenly Grace Strength\/HP Regen per Stack","talent_left":"-6s Hammer of Purity Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-2s Purification Cooldown","talent_left":"-30s Guardian Angel Cooldown"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+4s Heavenly Grace Duration","talent_left":"+50 Base Damage"}],"notes":["This attack damage talent is added as base attack damage.

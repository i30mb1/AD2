Laser cutting his way to freedom, Boush surfaced as the only Tinker to survive the Violet Plateau incident. Equipped with contraptions befitting a maniacal researcher, he launches Heat-Seeking Missiles from his shoulders, firing Warping Flares to dislocate his enemies. Unhindered by the delays of magic, the Tinker Rearms his deadly offensive gadgets and Defensive Matrices on the fly, wasting no time in demolishing anything that stands in his way.  Carry Nuker Pusher ","trivia":["The Tinker's voice actor, Harry \"Hal\" Robins, also voiced Dr. Isaac Kleiner in Half-Life 2 and the scientists of Black Mesa in Half-Life. Many of Tinker's voice lines reference characters and events from the Half-Life universe. In addition, the name \"Violet Plateau\" is quite similar to \"Black Mesa\", and the events described in Tinker's backstory are remarkably similar to the events of Half-Life. Tinker's responses upon killing Broodmother's Spiderlings Link▶️ \"Lamarr, is that you?\" and Link▶️ \"Lamarr?!\" are a reference to Dr. Kleiner's \"debeaked\" pet headcrab, Hedy Lamarr. Many of Tinker's lines while using Rearm come directly from Half-Life 2 including Link▶️ \"The massless field flux should self-limit\" and Link▶️ \"I've clamped the manifold parameters to\u2026 CY base and LG orbifold\u2026 Hilbert inclusive\". Link▶️ \"It's probably not a problem, probably\" is also a reference to Dr. Kleiner, who says it in the beginning of Half Life's second chapter right before the equipment he and his team are working on suffers a catastrophical malfunction and causes the alien invasion of Black Mesa. Link▶️ \"With my brains and your brawn, we'll make an excellent team\" is also a quote from Dr. Kleiner.","Tinker's responses upon killing Broodmother's Spiderlings Link▶️ \"Lamarr, is that you?\" and Link▶️ \"Lamarr?!\" are a reference to Dr. Kleiner's \"debeaked\" pet headcrab, Hedy Lamarr.","Many of Tinker's lines while using Rearm come directly from Half-Life 2 including Link▶️ \"The massless field flux should self-limit\" and Link▶️ \"I've clamped the manifold parameters to\u2026 CY base and LG orbifold\u2026 Hilbert inclusive\".","Link▶️ \"It's probably not a problem, probably\" is also a reference to Dr. Kleiner, who says it in the beginning of Half Life's second chapter right before the equipment he and his team are working on suffers a catastrophical malfunction and causes the alien invasion of Black Mesa.","Link▶️ \"With my brains and your brawn, we'll make an excellent team\" is also a quote from Dr. Kleiner."],"history":"Boush the Tinker's diminutive race is known for its intelligence, its cunning, and its prickly relationship with magic. As a matter of pride, they survive by their wits, and use only those powers of nature that may be unlocked through rational methodologies. Even this forbearance has led to a great deal of trouble, as Boush can attest. Once a key investigator of natural law, Boush the Tinker led a vast intellectual investigation into the workings of nature, founding a subterranean laboratory in the rumored, mist-wreathed wastes of the Violet Plateau. While scorning mages for the dangers they visit upon the world, Boush and his Tinker associates haughtily wrenched open a portal to some realm beyond comprehension and ushered in some nightmares of their own. A black mist rose from the cavernous interior of the Violet Plateau, shrouding it in permanent darkness from which sounds of horror perpetually emanate. Boush escaped with only his wits and the contraptions he carried, the sole Tinker to survive the Violet Plateau Incident.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+80 Laser Damage","talent_left":"+0.25s Heat-Seeking Missile Ministun"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"Defense Matrix Grants +25% Cooldown Reduction","talent_left":"-0.5s Keen Conveyance Channel Time"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+125 Defense Matrix Damage Absorbed","talent_left":"+1 Heat-Seeking Missile Count"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+2s Laser Blind Duration","talent_left":"+8% Manacost\/Manaloss Reduction"}],"notes":["The mana cost\/manaloss reduction talent stacks multiplicatively with other sources of mana loss reduction."]}}

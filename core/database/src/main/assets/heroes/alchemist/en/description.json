Having broken out of prison with his ogre accomplice, Razzil Darkbrew embarks on the search for new materials to use in his transmutations. Learned in alchemy, he created fields of corrosive, toxic Sludge Acids to accelerate his Greevil's Greed \u2014 extracting extra gold from creeps and Bounty Runes. With enough resources, it is rumored that Razzil has the secret formula to Synthesize a buff into the body that equals the legendary scepter. The Alchemist brews, atop the shoulders of his companion, an increasingly Unstable Concoction that is ideally thrown before it explodes. In a pinch, Razzil slips his partner with an Unknown Potion, inducing a Chemical Rage in the ogre's body. Symptoms include unnatural speeds, rapid health regeneration, and a pleasant purple hue.

However, when adulthood came calling he pushed aside the family trade to try his hand at manufacturing gold through Alchemy. In an act of audacity befitting his reputation, Razzil announced he would transmute an entire mountain into gold. Following two decades of research and spending and preparation, he failed spectacularly, quickly finding himself imprisoned for the widespread destruction his experiment wrought. Yet Razzil was never one to take a setback lightly, and sought escape to continue his research. When his new cellmate turned out to be a fierce ogre, he found just the opportunity he needed. After convincing the ogre not to eat him, Razzil set about carefully concocting a tincture for it to drink, made from the moulds and mosses growing in the prison stone work. In a week's time, it seemed ready. When the ogre drank the potion, it flew into an unstoppable berserker rage, destroying the cell bars and exploding through walls and guards alike. They soon found themselves lost somewhere in the forest surrounding the city with a trail of wreckage in their wake and no signs of pursuit. In the tonic's afterglow, the ogre seemed serene, happy, and even eager. Resolving to work together, the pair set off to collect the materials needed to attempt Razzil's Alchemic transmutation once more.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+50 Chemical Rage Movement Speed","talent_left":"+50 Chemical Rage Regeneration"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"-0.1s Chemical Rage Base Attack Time","talent_left":"+400 Unstable Concoction Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"Acid Spray grant armor to allies","talent_left":"+1.5 Damage per Greevil Greed stack"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+1 Acid Spray Armor Reduction","talent_left":"+125 Unstable Concoction Radius"}]}}

Obscured in the harshest of gusts of Sand Storms was the Sand King. From beneath the shifting dunes he ambushes and Burrowstrikes enemies from beneath, inflicting a desiccating and Caustic Venom that causes their corpses to erupt inside out. But true destruction was heralded by a beating tail. Within moments, the ground pulsed with violent tremors, and from its moving Epicenter, Crixalis pursued scattering foes until the very last fell to their knees. Across bazaars and between towns, the learned repeat a simple truth. Where the Sand King walks, the earth trembles.  Initiator Disabler Support Nuker Escape ","trivia":["In a very old version of DotA, there was a bug that caused the final pulse of Sand King's Epicenter to deal over 10,000 damage. The only unit that was able to survive this was a super beefed up Pudge that was used to measure the amount of damage dealt by the ability."],"history":"The sands of the Scintillant Waste are alive and sentient--the whole vast desert speaks to itself, thinking thoughts only such a vastness can conceive. But when it needs to find a form to communicate with those of more limited scope, it frees a fragment of itself, and fills a carapace of magic armor formed by the cunning Djinn of Qaldin. This essential identity calls itself Crixalis, meaning 'Soul of the Sand,' but others know it as Sand King. Sand King takes the form of a huge arachnid, inspired by the Scintillant Waste's small but ubiquitous denizens; and this is a true outward expression of his ferocious nature. Guardian, warrior, ambassador--Sand King is all of these things, inseparable from the endless desert that gave him life.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+5 Epicenter Pulses","talent_left":"35% Sand Storm Slow and Blind"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"-2s Burrowstrike Cooldown","talent_left":"+100 Epicenter Radius"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+125 Sand Storm Radius","talent_left":"+100 Caustic Finale Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+20 Sand Storm DPS","talent_left":"+0.3s Burrowstrike Stun Duration"}]}}

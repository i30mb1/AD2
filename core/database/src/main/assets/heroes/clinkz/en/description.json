As Clinkz loosed his final arrow, the demon Maraxiform ignited the land with Hellfire, burning him to the bone. Yet, the heroic bowman did not die. He had slain the demon, and unwittingly earned king-mage Sutherex's reward \u2014 Eternal life. Immortalized at the precipice of death, Clinkz now makes advantageous use of his skeletal body. Camouflaged, he walks into hostile lands, forming Death Pacts with wildlife to learn their ways and empower his shots and vitality. The demon's inferno burns within his ribs, with which he now rains Fiery Death upon his foes, Searing His Arrows to devastating effect. When backup is needed, Clinkz calls upon a Burning Army of skeletal compatriots, incinerating his foe in flames of their Hellfire barrage.  Carry Escape Pusher ","trivia":["Bone Fletcher's alternate\/fun name was \"Clinkz Eastwood\", a pun on the name of famed actor Clint Eastwood."],"history":"At the base of the Bleeding Hills stretches a thousand-league wood, a place called the Hoven, where black pools gather the tarry blood of the uplands, and the king-mage Sutherex sits in benevolent rule. Once a sworn protector of the Hoven lands, Clinkz earned a reputation for his skill with a bow. In the three-hundredth year of the king-mage, the demon Maraxiform rose from Sixth Hell to lay claim to the forest. In response, the king-mage decreed an unbreakable spell: to any who slew the demon would be granted Life Without End. Unaware of the spell, Clinkz waded into battle, defending his lands against the demon's fiery onslaught. Clinkz drove Maraxiform back to the gates of Sixth Hell itself, where on that fiery threshold the two locked in a mortal conflict. Grievously wounded, the demon let out a blast of Hellfire as Clinkz loosed his final arrow. The arrow struck the demon true as Hellfire poured out across the land, lighting the black pools and burning Clinkz alive at the instant of the demon's death. Thus, the mage's spell took effect at the very moment of the archer's conflagration, preserving him in this unholy state, leaving him a being of bones and rage, caught in the very act of dying, carrying Hell's breath with him on his journey into eternity.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+25% Burning Barrage Damage","talent_left":"Searing Arrows Multishot"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+125 Attack Range","talent_left":"+3 Burning Barrage arrows"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+20% Death Pact Health","talent_left":"Death Pact Steal creep abilities"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+20 Searing Arrows Damage","talent_left":"-3s Skeleton Walk Cooldown"}],"notes":["The attack range talent also affects the cast range of Searing Arrows, and the range of Burning Barrage."]}}

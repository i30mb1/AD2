into elemental spirits with unique abilities. For nine days Mangix fought the master of his order, both warriors swilling and striking in equal measure, until at last the elder collapsed into a drunken stupor. Having claimed the title of Brewmaster, Mangix now wanders the land as a Drunken Brawler, swinging and evading with unpredictable finesse. Under one arm he holds a great keg, and not merely for storing his Cinder Brew. Mangix drenches himself and enemies in alcohol, strengthening himself in an advanced state of inebriation based on his stance, while disorienting enemies before slamming the barrel down with a Thunder Clap. Rumor around taverns is that the Brewmaster is actually composed of Elemental Spirits, each with their own unique abilities, and should one catch him sufficiently intoxicated, one may just witness this Primal Split in action.

Born to a mother's flesh by a Celestial father, the youth known as Mangix was the first to grow up with the talents of both lineages. He trained with the greatest aesthetes of the Order, eventually earning, through diligent drunkenness, the right to challenge for the title of Brewmaster, that appellation most honored among the contemplative malt-brewing sect. As much drinking competition as mortal combat, Mangix for nine days drank and fought the elder master. For nine nights they stumbled and whirled, chugged and struck, until at last the elder warrior collapsed into a drunken stupor, and a new Brewmaster was named. Now the new, young Brewmaster calls upon the strength of his Oyo forebears to speed his staff. When using magic, it is to his spirit ancestors that he turns. Like all Brewmasters before him, he was sent out from his people with a single mission. He wanders the land, striving toward enlightenment through drink, searching for the answer to the ancient spiritual schism. Hoping to think the single thought that will unite the spirit and physical planes again.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Brewlings Gain Drunken Brawler Passive","talent_left":"Cinder Brew applies Fear when ignited"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+1200 Brewlings Health","talent_left":"+80 Attack Speed"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+30% Cinder Brew Damage\/Duration","talent_left":"+1x Drunken Brawler Brewed Up Multiplier"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+15 Damage","talent_left":"+200 Thunder Clap AoE"}],"notes":["This attack damage talent is added as bonus attack damage.

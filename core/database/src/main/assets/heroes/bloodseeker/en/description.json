The Flayed Twins' obscene demand for blood could only be met through constant carnage, a task for which Strygwyr was more than suited. Driven by insatiable Thirst, the Bloodseeker senses blood of the mortally wounded from leagues away, and chases them down with eager speed. Through sacred markings on his gear, the blood of the freshly sacrificed flows directly to the Flayed Ones, leaving just enough to mend his wounds and fuel his imbued Rage. Strygwyr paints the land with a crimson ring, silencing foes caught in this Blood Ritual. Forcing difficult decisions on his enemies, for those who run only hasten their own demise. The Bloodseeker Ruptures every artery, causing his victim to hemorrhage with each step. To satisfy the demands of the Flayed Twins, Bloodseeker even goes as far to sacrifice some of his, spraying his own blood around him in a Bloody Mist. By blood loss or by Strygwyr's tribal blades, death is but a foregone conclusion.

The Flayed Ones require oceanic amounts of blood to keep them sated and placated, and would soon drain their mountain empire of its populace if the priests of the high plateaus did not appease them. Strygwyr therefore goes out in search of carnage. The vital energy of any blood he lets, flows immediately to the Twins through the sacred markings on his weapons and armor. Over the years, he has come to embody the energy of a vicious hound; in battle he is savage as a jackal. Beneath the Mask of the Bloodseeker, in the rush of bloody quenching, it is said that you can sometime see the features of the Flayers taking direct possession of their hound.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"2 Rupture Charges","talent_left":"+18 Max Thirst MS"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+425 Rupture Cast Range","talent_left":"15% Spell Lifesteal"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+8% Rupture Initial Damage","talent_left":"+85 Blood Rite Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+25 Bloodrage Attack Speed","talent_left":"+8% Bloodrage Spell Amplification"}],"notes":["The spell lifesteal talent stacks additively with other sources of spell lifesteal.

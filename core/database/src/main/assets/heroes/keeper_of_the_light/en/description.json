Ezalor long ago escaped the Fundamental Plane, separating from the other ancient forces to which he was bound within the great Primordial harmony. He is a power grown sentient in the dawn of the universe, and now rides forth in all planes at once, one step ahead of pursuing chaos, bearing his gift with him at the end of a radiant staff. His majestic truth lies hidden beneath the outward appearance of a slightly doddering old man who barely stays in the saddle. However, when faced with the challenge of chaos, or the forces of darkness, his primordial light bursts forth, and his full power is revealed, transforming him once again into a force to be reckoned with.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"+1.2s Blinding Light Stun","talent_left":"+180 Illuminate Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+15s Spirit Form Duration","talent_left":"Chakra Magic Dispels"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"-4s Chakra Magic Cooldown","talent_left":"2 Solar Bind Charges"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+30% Blinding Light Miss","talent_left":"-2s Illuminate Cooldown"}]}}

Ezalor's staff Illuminates the darkest corners, banishing evil from the realm. He replenishes his companions with Chakra Magic, while casting a Blinding Light over the land, causing attacks to miss.

Effortlessly weakening his foes, Binding them to the primordial light. Revealing his full power, he enters Spirit Form, riding forth in all planes at once, Recalling his allies to further press the assault.  Support Nuker Disabler Jungler ★★☆",

    "Ezalor's design in Dota 2 makes several references to Gandalf, an iconic character from The Lord of the Rings book series. His clothing is almost purely white, similar to Gandalf's attire. Illuminate's wave animation are a group of stampeding white horses. This is similar to the spell Gandalf cast on the torrent of water, at the ford of Bruinen, in the first book, The Fellowship of the Ring. Additionally, it has similarities to his reinforcements at Helm's Deep during the second book, The Two Towers. This is also depicted in the splash art, with Ezalor taking Gandalf's place at the head of the charge. The Mana Leak cast line Link▶️ \"You shall not cast!\" is a reference to one of Gandalf's most famous quotes: \"You shall not pass!\"[1] The unused Mana Leak cast line Link▶️ \"Run! Run, I say!\" is a reference to another one of Gandalf's famous quotes: \"Fly, you fools!\"[2] The respawn lines Link▶️ \"Ezalor... I think that's my name\" is likely a reference to Gandalf \"respawning\" as The White: \"Gandalf? ... Yes ... That was my name ... Gandalf the Grey.\" One of Ezalor's cosmetic items, the Wise Cap of the First Light makes him look even more like Gandalf.",

  "history": "Upon a pale horse he rides, this spark of endless suns, this Keeper of the Light. Ezalor long ago escaped the Fundamental Plane, separating from the other ancient forces to which he was bound within the great Primordial harmony. He is a power grown sentient in the dawn of the universe, and now rides forth in all planes at once, one step ahead of pursuing chaos, bearing his gift with him at the end of a radiant staff. His majestic truth lies hidden beneath the outward appearance of a slightly doddering old man who barely stays in the saddle. However, when faced with the challenge of chaos, or the forces of darkness, his primordial light bursts forth, and his full power is revealed, transforming him once again into a force to be reckoned with.",

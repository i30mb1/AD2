It is said that the things that grow here, grow strangely. To the forces of nature this is a sacred place, made to stay hidden and unknown. Many are the traps and dangers of this land. There are all-consuming grasses, crossbred fauna and poisonous flowers, but none are so fierce as the mighty Treant Protectors. These ageless, titanic beings, charged with keeping the peace in this dangerous land, ensure that none within encroach without reason, and none without poach their secrets. For time untold they tended to their holy ground, uninterrupted, only dimly aware of the changing world beyond. Yet inevitably the wider world grew aware of this untamed land, and with each passing winter the outsiders grew bolder. Soon they arrived with tools to cut and with flames to burn, and often the Treants would ponder: who are these fragile, industrious creatures? What now had become of the wild, green world? There came and went an age of questions and of doubts, a thousand summers of long traditions set to scrutiny, while more and more the outsiders died and fed their earth. When all that bloomed had finally finished their say, curiosity had overcome caution. It was decided: a lone protector would be sent into the wider world, and instructed to wander until the glaciers arose once more, to observe the changing land and its creatures, and to discover what unknown dangers could threaten their sacred ground.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"Overgrowth Undispellable","talent_left":"450 AoE Living Armor"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+8 Living Armor Bonus Armor","talent_left":"+40 Leech Seed Damage\/Heal"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+15% Leech Seed Movement Slow","talent_left":"+30 Nature's Grasp Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+2 Living Armor Heal Per Second","talent_left":"-5s Nature's Grasp Cooldown"}]}}

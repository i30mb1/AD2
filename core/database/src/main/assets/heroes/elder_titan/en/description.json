Even the greatest of Titans err in their work. Trapped in his own flawed creation, the Worldsmith seeks forever to repair the fissured planes. His Natural Order reduces all to its base, disintegrating whatever defenses his foes layer themselves with. From a hidden plane, the Elder Titan draws aspects of himself, summoning his Astral Sprit, sending this ghostly form through bodies and past defenses. Once positioned, an Echo Stomp rings out from both Titan and Spirit, knocking unconscious all in its wake. The battlefield cracks under the Titan's forge hammer, and a glimpse of creation is seen as the Earth Splitter rends the ground asunder. For what the Worldsmith makes, he can also unmake.

The name change was likely done to avoid copyright issues with \"Blizzard Entertainment\", since the Tauren is an existing race in the \"Warcraft\" universe."],"history":"Well may you ask, \"How did this world take its form?\" Why of all the worlds in creation, has this one its strange properties, its diverse and motley collection of creatures, cultures and lore? \"The answer,\" One whispers, \"lies with the Titans.\" These original progenitors were there near the Beginning\u2014if not actual witnesses to the creation, then born with it still echoing in their ears. Stamped with the earliest energies of the universe, they wished nothing more than to continue as creators themselves. Thus they bent to the task of shaping matter to their will: hammering and heating, bending and blasting. And when matter proved less challenging than they liked, they turned their tools upon themselves, reshaping their minds and reforging their spirits until they had become beings of great endurance. Reality itself became the ultimate object of their smithing. Yet, along the way, they sometimes erred. In cases of great ambition, mistakes are unavoidable. The one we know as the Elder Titan was a great innovator, one who studied at the forge of creation. In honing his skills, he shattered something that could never be repaired, only thrown aside. He fell into his own broken world, a shattered soul himself. There he dwelt among the jagged shards and fissured planes, along with other lost fragments that had sifted down through the cracks in the early universe. And this is why the world we know resembles an isle of castaways, survivors of a wreck now long forgotten. Forgotten, that is, by all but the One who blames himself. He spends his time forever seeking a way to accomplish the repairs, that he might rejoin the parts of his broken soul, that we and the world alike might all be mended. This is the One we know as Elder Titan.","talents":{"hero_talents":[{"talent_lvl":"25","talent_right":"-60 Earth Splitter Cooldown","talent_left":"+450 Echo Stomp Wake Damage"},{"talent_lvl":"20","talent_right":"+100% Cleave","talent_left":"+100 Natural Order Radius"},{"talent_lvl":"15","talent_right":"+75 Echo Stomp Damage","talent_left":"+25 Astral Spirit Hero Attack"},{"talent_lvl":"10","talent_right":"+2% Astral Spirit Move Speed Per Hero","talent_left":"+25 Attack Speed"}],"notes":["Cleave from talents is not disabled by Break."]}}

    "Despite being Zeus' son, Mars is named after the Roman god of war, instead of the Greek equivalent, Ares, who is the son of the Greek god Zeus. However, lines from Mars ( Linkâ¶ï¸ \"I don't answer to that name anymore, you old fool.\") and Zeus themselves ( Linkâ¶ï¸ \"Change your name all you want, you can't fool me.\") hint that Mars has changed his previous name of Ares, possibly to avoid association with his father. He also refers to himself as \"Mars Ultor\". In real life, this is the same name given to the Roman god Mars by the emperor Caesar Augustus when he created a cult of the same name. Mars Ultor means \"Mars the Avenger\" in Latin. Mars' Immortal Off-hand item, God's Mercy, references elements from the Greek Myth as well, namely Perseus and Medusa. Perseus (who is another one of the Greek god Zeus' sons) uses a polished shield to act as a mirror to approach and behead the sleeping Medusa without looking directly at her eyes, thereby avoiding her infamous stone gaze. Perseus also used Medusa's head as a weapon to turn King Atlas into stone.",

  "history": "Mars, first son of Heaven, spent a long existence waging endless war, and saw countless more crusades waged beneath the banner of his old name. Wars of conquest and of vengeance. Just and unjust... Always cruel. So much like his father, Mars indulged his basest impulses--with inclinations much more monstrous than those of Zeus--and he inflicted suffering untold. But as the epochs vanished behind him, the selfish ways of his father--the ways of many amongst his godly kin, they who judged him despicable--eventually began to ring hollow. War for its own sake was no longer enough to satisfy his desires. For the first time in his ageless days, the god of war began to question to what ends he swung his glorious spear. As the Fates would have it, his solution came easily: he must wage war for a larger purpose, and inspire more than mere savagery and sorrow at the sight of his crest. He must at last lay claim to the mantle of leadership that is his birthright, for the time has come to burn down the pantheon of the old age and build a just new empire atop the ashes of his kin. Only then might he find satisfaction, and make the glory of Mars evident to all.",

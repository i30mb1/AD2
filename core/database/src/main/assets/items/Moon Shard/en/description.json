    "The item works very well with illusions especially with mana burn, critical hits and low base attack time.",
    "In games where a player finds themselves with more gold than they can spend, due to having all 6 item slots filled out, it may be worth considering purchasing a Moon Shard to consume immediately.",
    "It may be prudent for players to purchase the Moon Shard as their sixth item, to fill in an inventory slot and gain its full benefits while they farm a seventh item to replace Moon Shard, which only provides half the attack speed and night vision after consumption.",
    "In very extreme late-game scenarios, heroes that have nothing better to do with their gold should consider buying Moon Shards to give to their teammates."

    "The ability to reflect single-target abilities back to their casters is actually an old ability concept in Dota. It was first seen in version 6.00 as a chance-based passive ability, belonging to Linken's Mirror, the pre-rework version of Linken's Sphere. The ability was removed in 6.09 and replaced by Spell Block, as Linken's Sphere got reworked."

    "Projectile-based abilities are nearly always reflected upon impact. This makes them easier to reflect than spells with instant effect because the Echo Shell can be placed on the targeted unit before the projectile hits."

  "tips": [
    "Gem of True Sight is a risky investment, due to it dropping on death and potentially giving the enemy a free Gem. Therefore, this item should only be bought when having enough survivability and when other True Sight items are not enough.",
    "Although often purchased by supports, Gem of True Sight is better carried by more resilient tanks and initiators, who are less likely to die and lose it.",
    "In the early game, when heroes are more stationary farming the lanes, Sentry Wards are a far more efficient way to avoid being ganked by invisible heroes.",
    "Due to the True Sight being a passive aura, it constantly reveals nearby invisible enemies, making it the most cost-effective revealing item, hence the heavy drawback.",
    "Gem of True Sight can still sometimes be a worthwhile investment when the enemy has no invisible heroes. It is ideal to reliably remove enemy Observer and Sentry Wards over a long term, as the only alternative item to do this is Sentry Wards, but they can be easily wasted if the enemy ward locations are unknown.",
    "Gem of True Sight can be cast on ward spots to reveal and detect Observer Wards and Sentries."

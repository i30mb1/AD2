    "You can keep the bonus mana for 10 seconds so you can use the item even if you don't cast your abilities immediately to put your item on cooldown. Using the item each time it is ready is equivalent of having 6 mana regeneration per second, making it by far the most cost-effective mana regeneration item of the game.",

    "Make sure you are safe before using Soul Ring, as the reduced health can make your hero much more vulnerable. If your hero has low health or no means of regenerating health, consider picking up Tranquil Boots too in order to refill health after using the active a lot. By the same token, this item is very good on strength heroes due to their larger health pools and health regeneration rates. Heroes with increased base health regeneration rates may benefit more from this item as well.",

    "Against heroes with mana burning abilities, Soul Ring can give you enough mana to get an important spell off in a fight.",
    "Consider dropping items that increase mana capacity before using Soul Ring and picking them back up afterwards. Dropping those items decreases your mana capacity while current mana percentage remains the same, but Soul Ring still gives the full amount of mana. Picking up the items afterwards increases mana capacity while retaining the same percentage, thus resulting in a net gain of mana. As an added bonus, the extra mana gained through this method does not count as having been gained through the Soul Ring, and as such, will not be lost at the end of the duration even if unused."

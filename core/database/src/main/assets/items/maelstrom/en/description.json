  "tips": [
    "Maelstrom is a very good item for speeding up farming. If the extra experience is not needed, it is a good alternative to Hand of Midas.",
    "It is also great to deal with illusions or mass-summons like Broodmother's spiders, Nature's Prophet's treants, etc. Especially useful for ranged heroes that lack area damage, since they cannot make use of cleave.",
    "The Chain Lightning deals magical damage which ignores armor and Damage Block, making it good against heroes that get a Vanguard, or Tidehunter with his Kraken Shell, and against heroes with high armor like Dragon Knight or Terrorblade.",
    "Maelstrom is a useful pickup against mega creeps in order to help clear waves."

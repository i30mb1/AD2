    "It is great to be placed near towers, so it can help heroes gank over them.",
    "Sentry Wards' detection radius is quite large, making them useful for keeping an eye out on invisible heroes in key areas, given one has vision over that area.",
    "Sentry Wards are commonly used to de-ward enemy wards, as they are able to detect their wards. When dewarding, the ward is best placed so that its true sight reaches multiple common ward spots, so that it is more likely to spot enemy wards. If an enemy ward location is known, the sentry ward is best placed so that the enemy won't find it when they try to deward the sentry wards, like between some trees, but still so that their ward is within true sight range.",

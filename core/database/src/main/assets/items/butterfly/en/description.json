    "If someone in your team already has evasion like Phantom Assassin or another Butterfly, decide if increasing evasion will be a good idea as the enemy team will generally rush a Monkey King Bar. The more evasion a team has, the more valuable Monkey King Bar gets for the enemy team. However, if the enemy team is greatly suppressed and underfarmed, increasing evasion could be a good decision."

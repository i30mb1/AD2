    "This is an overall good and cheap utility item for saving allies and messing up enemy positioning.",
    "Force can push units over cliffs and through trees, making it a great chasing or escaping item.",
    "It is also good for countering Heroes that can make impassable barriers, such as Earthshaker, Clockwerk or Nature's Prophet.",
    "Unlike Blink Dagger, the item is not disabled when receiving damage, allowing for both initiation and escape (but the distance is shorter). And it can be upgraded into an hurricane pike even for melee heroes late game to get extra stats compared to the blink dagger.",
    "Force Staff is the cheapest item to disable a Linken's Sphere allowing you to use more powerful spells like Hex from a Scythe of Vyse and\/or Soul Rend from Bloodthorn.",
    "When chasing enemies, the Force Staff can be used to chase down enemies easily and disable them although one should use it with extreme caution."

    "In the original DotA, this item was called \"Scroll of Town Portal\".",
    "On the August 13, 2018 Patch, a new Town Portal Scroll with a green icon made its way into the main game. The item's active worked like the teleport of Boots of Travel 2, and costed only 50 . The item was available in every game mode until it was fixed\/removed one hour later in a hotfix patch. The item's purpose is unknown, but it was most likely intended to be part of Mutation Mode, due to being added in the same patch that added the Pocket Roshan item.",
    "The description of the item is a reference to the very first Dota 2 Gamescom trailer.",
    "Activating a Town Portal Scroll appears to require the casting hero's blood. This can be seen in the trailer, and in a scene the first episode Dota: Dragon's Blood, where Bram draws blood from his hand. Dragon Knight's as Davion of Dragon Hold also draws blood from his hand during the custom teleport animation.",

  "tips": [
    "Town Portal Scrolls are arguably the most important mobility items in the game and should be carried by every hero. They can easily prevent deaths or make kills possible when used correctly. When getting ganked, the teleport can be used to escape. However, one has to make sure first that the enemy cannot interrupt the teleport, by either waiting until they use their disables first, or by hiding\/obstructing vision in case of single-target disables and teleport while they have no vision. Inversely, they can also be used to teleport to help an ally who is getting ganked. The incoming teleport may cause enemies to retreat and give up chasing the ally and thus not get a kill, or they still go for it and risk losing some of their heroes in return. It is well worth to cancel the teleport if the enemy decides to give up chasing, costing the player 100 , but preventing the enemy from gaining gold and the ally from losing gold and time.",

    "Their cheap cost makes it very easy to buy them frequently, which is fully worth it, even in the very late game.",
    "As a carry, Town Portal Scrolls can be used to speed up farming, by teleporting from lane to lane after clearing the waves through to the enemy's next tower. Instead of having to walk to another place to farm, the teleport can be used to instantly get to the next farm location and keep on farming.",
    "In the lategame, teleport scrolls are crucial to fight against split-pushing enemies. When being far away from a tower which is getting pushed, a teleport is the only way to get there fast and defend the tower. This also goes for base-racing. When the enemy team is faster, teleporting back to base to defend can be the game-winning move."

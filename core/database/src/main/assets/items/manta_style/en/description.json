    "The Manta Style is less effective on ranged heroes except with heroes with attack modifiers that works on illusions like Luna Moon Glaives bounce, Drow Ranger's high agility and Morphling which mostly buy stats items that benefits illusions.",
    "Works with Lone Druid's Spirit Bear.",
    "The illusions can be used to scout to secure your farming, prepare a gank, or before attacking Roshan. They are useful to deward and destroy Techies' mines but they don't get True Sight from Gem.",
    "The active of the Manta Style applies a basic dispel, so it can replace a Linken's Sphere against a Bloodthorn or Rod of Atos.",
    "Illusions inherit effects such as critical strike and Manabreak, albeit diminished.As a result, Daedalus and Diffusal Blade synergise well with Manta."

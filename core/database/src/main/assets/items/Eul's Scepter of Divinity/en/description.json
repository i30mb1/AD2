    "Cyclone can be used in the following situations: Offensively by disabling an enemy before a gank, giving you the time to set up your abilities. On fleeing enemies to give your team the time to surround the target. On enemies in teamfights to take them out of the fight for a few seconds. This is especially effective on carries. ↓↓ Double-tapping during teamfights, baiting enemies into using their abilities on you, then becoming invulnerable to interrupt their burst damage. To buy yourself a little more time for abilities and items to come off cooldown, especially items like Blink Dagger or Blade Mail. On an enemy who has activated items like Blade Mail, Mask of Madness or Lotus Orb. Doing so will waste the duration of those items.",

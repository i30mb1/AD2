  "tips": [
    "Tangos are a very effective source of combat heal during early-game, as they do not dispel upon taking damage. When an engagement seems even or against you, using a Tango can tilt the balance in your favor.",
    "Although one Tango charge heals much less and does so slower than a Healing Salve, one set of Tangos provides slightly more health per gold spent. Also, the fact that it is not dispelled by damage and its secondary effect of destroying trees makes it more versatile than Healing Salves. So if no quick and strong healing is required, Tangos are usually more valuable.",
    "Since using Tangos on a tree destroys the tree, it can be used to create alternate pathways between some trees, making it easier to escape or chase enemies. Sometimes it is worth it to use a Tango just for this purpose.",
    "Unlike other restoring consumables, it is possible to give allies one charge of the Tangos stack. This allows players to grant lane healing to another hero without having to be there.",
    "Can be also used to control certain heroes by destroying trees. For example, perching Monkey King off the tree he is on, gaining vision by devouring the tree created by Sprout."

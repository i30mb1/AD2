    "Combine it with an Hurricane Pike to push away your target then root him for preventing your enemy from attacking or escaping.",
    "The item can be used for ganking, chasing survivors after a team fight, or to escape.",
    "The very long cast range makes the Rod of Atos an effective item to disable an enemy Linken's Sphere from afar, although it requires the projectile to connect."

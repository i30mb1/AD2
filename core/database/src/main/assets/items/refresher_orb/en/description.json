    "Using Refresher Orb allows some skills to have two instances running simultaneously; for example, Eye of the Storm, Chaotic Offering. Note though that some spells are specifically coded to not be able to run multiple instances at the same time (e.g. Exorcism). Before building Refresher Orb, be sure that the ability you aim to use it with supports multiple instances at the same time or is worth having its duration doubled.",

    "If the game goes on for a very long time and you end up with gold to spare, consider picking up a Refresher Orb to refresh items such as Satanic and Black King Bar."

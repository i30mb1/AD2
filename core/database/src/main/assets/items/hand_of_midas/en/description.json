    "The earlier Hand of Midas is purchased, the earlier it will pay itself off during the match and the earlier you will have an effective net worth gain. Assuming it is always used when off cooldown and used on a unit with a gold bounty of 160, Hand of Midas increases the user's GPM by 96 , meaning it takes a minimum of 21.67 minutes to pay for itself, or 16.67 minutes for the recipe (from the point on it was first used). This means you need to use Transmute 13.75 times to pay for itself, or 10.94 times for just the recipe. Ogre Magi with his Multicast and Arc Warden with the Tempest Double will have their Hand of Midas paid out effectively earlier than other heroes.",

    "Blink requires heroes to face the direction in which they are blinking. This means that heroes facing away from their blink destination will have to turn first, causing a slight delay depending on their turn rate.",
    "Hood of Defiance's barrier blocks damage over time, meaning that it will prevent items like Radiance from resetting Blink Dagger's cooldown.",
    "Use Blink to dodge incoming projectile-based spells such as Storm Hammer or Spirit Lance, and from items like Rod of Atos.",
    "When Blink dagger go into cooldown upon taking damage on an escape, a quick self-cast with Eul's Scepter of Divinity will allow you to wait the short cooldown relatively safely and blink out the moment you land on the ground.",
    "Blink Dagger can turn into a very strong escape tool if you are affected by False Promise."

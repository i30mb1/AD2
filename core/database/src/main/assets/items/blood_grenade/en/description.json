    "Blood Grenade is usually purchased before the horn, as it allows for easier First Blood attempts, along with other sources of crowd control.",
    "Later on, this item is usually purchased by slow-moving supports, allowing to make more effective usage of their empty slots to assist in ganks and teamfights.",
    "Due to its long cast range combined with low cost and damage over time effect, Blood Grenade is also very effective against enemy heroes wielding Blink Dagger, should your team not have any other sources of long range damage."

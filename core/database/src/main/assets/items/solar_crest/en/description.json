        "Unlike Medallion, Solar Crest does not place a debuff on the caster. Instead, its effects are directly bound to its cooldown. Its duration is always 12 seconds on the target, while the duration on self varies with cooldown manipulation (i.e. cooldown reduction and resetting). When the ability's cooldown is reduced, the reduction effects on self are briefer. The reduction effects on self also disappear immediately when the cooldown is refreshed. This also means that the effects on self are also applied when using Medallion of Courage, since they share a cooldown.",

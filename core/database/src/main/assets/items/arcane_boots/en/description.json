  "tips": [
    "If the player drops items which provides a large amount of mana (e.g. Bloodstone or Eye of Skadi), then uses Arcane Boots, and then picks up the dropped items again, the player will overall gain far more than 160 mana. This is because upon dropping the mana granting items, the player's maximum mana drops while the current mana percentage stays the same, but Arcane Boots still gives the full amount. After picking up the items again, its maximum mana raises, and its current mana percentage stays the same."

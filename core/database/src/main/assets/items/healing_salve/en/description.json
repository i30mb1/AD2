    "The Healing Salve's effect gets dispelled upon taking player-based damage, so do not use it in the middle of combat. In some situations, however, it may be worth it to use it in combat. Even one second long of its healing can be enough to prevent deaths in some situations.",

    "Depending on the hero, in the early-game, one Salve can refill almost all of a hero's health. It spares the hero from having to move back to the team's fountain to heal back up, which can take a lot of time, or cost the player a Town Portal Scroll. Unlike Tango, Healing Salve is more suited for a defensive lane. If the lane carry tries to farm and takes some damage, he can fall back for a short time to quickly heal back up and continue farming.",

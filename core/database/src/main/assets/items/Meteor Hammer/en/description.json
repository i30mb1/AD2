    "Meteor Hammer can be hard to aim, as the long and obvious casting allows most opponents to interrupt or dodge the ability. Use the active in conjunction with disables, or after the target has expended their escape abilities.",
    "If you find yourself vulnerable to disables, you want to invest for a Black King Bar or a Linken's Sphere to prevent your channelling from getting interrupted easily.",

    "Meteor Hammer can be used to quickly clear jungle stacks and creep waves."

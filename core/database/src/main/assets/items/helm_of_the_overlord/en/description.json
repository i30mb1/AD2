    "A dominated creep can be used as a scout that can be placed inside Roshan's pit. Just be sure not to place it too close to Roshan, so he does not attack it.",
    "Dominate always sets the creep's base movement speed to 380. The only units which have more than 425 movement speed are Lycan Wolves at level 3 or higher. This means dominating one of them actually reduces their base speed down to 380. Besides these, all other dominatable creeps have lower movement speed than 380."

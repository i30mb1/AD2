  "tips": [
    "Radiance has one of the hardest build-ups in the game, as rushing the 3750 for a Sacred Relic forces you to save up a lot of gold at once rather than ramping up your strength with cheaper items. Early deaths can be especially problematic for a Radiance builder, and may force the player to give up on Radiance and build a different item. Inform your team if you are building a Radiance.",
    "It is recommended to avoid being visible on the map and avoid uncertain fights when close to the purchase of the Sacred Relic.",
    "With a Manta Style or an illusion ability, you can farm multiple lanes and wood camps at once and push the lanes safely.",
    "Radiance's constant area damage is great at disabling enemy Blink Daggers, preventing enemies from initiating or escaping with it. However, they can still initiate with it if they have enough vision, due to the blink's range being higher than the Burn Aura's reach.",
    "It can be combined with a Shiva's Guard to have an AoE magic damage ability, slow your enemies and protect your team further from physical damage.",
    "The damage from Radiance procs Spell Lifesteal. Illusions themselves can recover health while dealing damage to enemy creeps and heroes, allowing them to survive longer. Only the first illusion or hero that burns an enemy lifesteals from it.",
    "It is extremely discouraged to purchase more than one Radiance on the same team, as the auras do not stack."

    "Remember that the Tranquil Boots' health regeneration doesn't stop or reset the cooldown if you are casting a spell. You can get a Soul Ring and spam long range abilities and keep the regeneration active.",
    "Right Click attacks disable the health regeneration, if you drop the boots you will keep it active or not reset their cooldown.",
    "If you have invisibility you can stay in experience range while you regenerate your health safely. Be careful that the enemy doesn't have detection (e.g. Sentry Ward or Dust of Appearance.",
    "The item is great for roamers, rapidly restoring a hero's health while moving to another lane."

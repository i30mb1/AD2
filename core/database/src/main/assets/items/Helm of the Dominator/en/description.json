When owning both, Helm of the Dominator and Helm of the Overlord, Helm of the Overlord takes priority, still allowing a maximum of 1 unit. This also goes for the Tempest Double's copied Helm of the Dominator. When the Dominated creep changes faction (i.e. when affected by Holy Persuasion or Enchant), it no longer counts towards the max limit. When the item gets upgraded, sold, or destroyed, the dominated creep dies. The death is not credited to anyone so that no one gets experience from it.",

    "Dominated creeps can be used to remotely stack an ancient camp. Some creeps have abilities that are very useful, such as Dark Troll Summoner and Ogre Frostmage.",

    "A dominated creep can be used as a scout that can be placed inside Roshan's pit. Just be sure not to place it too close to Roshan, so he does not attack it.",
    "Dominate always sets the creep's base movement speed to 380. The only units which have more than 425 movement speed are Lycan Wolves at level 3 or higher. This means dominating one of them actually reduces their base speed down to 380. Besides these, all other dominatable creeps have lower movement speed than 380."

    "Octarine Core's name is an homage to the comic fantasy book series Discworld, paying tribute to the writer Terry Pratchett who died about a month prior to the item's release. In the series, Octarine is a fictional color which is described as \"resembling a flourescent greenish-yellow purple\". The color can only be seen by wizards and by cats, which is also referenced by Octarine Core's item lore.",

    "If you have a hero with short cooldowns on your abilities, consider this item; casting your spells more often in a single fight is a major boon, and the increased casting range allows you to do so without having to stay in the middle of the fight for an extended duration."

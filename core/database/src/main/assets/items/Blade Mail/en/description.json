    "It is a powerful counter against Bloodthorn and Silver Edge to prevent enemies from attacking you while under the debuff.",
    "Enemies with copious amounts of damage resistance or high health could very easily ignore Blade Mail's ability. Heroes like Ursa, Spectre, and Abaddon are good examples of said resistant heroes, as are items such as Pipe of Insight or Heart of Tarrasque.",
    "It can be useful to get Blade Mail if you get outcarried, to counter the DPS and turn the enemy's damage against them.",
    "Buy it as a counter if the opposing team has high damage (crits, nukes or attack speed) and have low health. If timed properly, some heroes can get killed just from their own damage. And even if you cannot do that, it could make the enemy hesitant to attack you for 5.5 seconds.",
    "A good situation to use Blade Mail is if you're inflicted with a heavy damage over time ability. For example, you can kill (or severely damage) Bloodseeker by walking around with Rupture, or Tinker by staying under his March of the Machines. However, do make sure that you yourself can take the damage you'll be receiving, else you'll just be helping the enemy instead.",
    "The return damage is only dealt to the unit who attacks. Therefore, Techies' mines, Witch Doctor's Death Ward and Shadow Shaman's Mass Serpent Ward won't affect their main hero as they are considered separate units. Since the Blade Mail returns damage on the unit that attacks the owner, you can use Book of the Dead units to attack and the melee Necronomicon Warrior will die quicker to return 800 damage.",
    "Since the Blade Mail returns damage on the unit that attacks the owner, you can use Book of the Dead units to attack and the melee Necronomicon Warrior will die quicker to return 800 damage.",
    "This is a commonly bought item for initiator heroes that can soak up some damage (commonly Strength heroes), such as Clockwerk or Spirit Breaker.",
    "Blade Mail is less effective with evasion and attack slow because it reduces the hits you receive, and thus the damage you can return.",
    "It also loses effectiveness against enemies who can turn themselves or their allies invulnerable with abilities like Phase Shift or Astral Imprisonment, or with Eul's Scepter of Divinity, as Blade Mail cannot damage invulnerable units.",
    "It is an ultimate counter against heroes who rely on critical strikes such as Phantom Assassin, Bounty Hunter, Wraith King, etc. Also against Crystalys or its upgrade Daedalus."

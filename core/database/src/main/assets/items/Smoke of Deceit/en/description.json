  "tips": [
    "Though it cannot be used for daring escapes or to gain the upper hand in the middle of combat, Smoke of Deceit plays a cunning role against a well-warded team. The added mobility makes it easy to set up surprise attacks or to slip behind enemies without being spotted. However, if a hero hidden with Smoke of Deceit comes too close to an enemy hero or building, the effect ends, meaning you should keep your distance. Smoke of Deceit is especially useful to get to Roshan undetected as many players ward the surrounding area.",
    "Since True Sight cannot reveal units affected by Smoke of Deceit, it can be used to dodge certain abilities like Thundergod's Wrath and other spells which require vision in order to hit their targets. This also goes for disjointable projectiles. It is even possible to disjoint Assassinate. The True Sight applied by Assassinate is unable to reveal smoked units and therefore gets disjointed.",

    "Dragon Lance is great for ranged heroes that suffer from low attack range, like Luna or Templar Assassin. Those heroes' powerful attacks are mainly limited by their attack range, which Dragon Lance can fix.",
    "Enchantress can throw out very painful Impetus attacks when combined with Aghanim's Scepter, reaching more than 800 attack range. The strength and attack speed bonus are great for her as well, as she is lacking all of that. It can also be built into Hurricane Pike, which is a very useful and complementary item for her."

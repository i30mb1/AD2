  "tips": [
    "Because Tome is relatively cheap for the amount of experience it provides, it is generally advisable for someone on your team to buy and use it about as soon as each one becomes available.",
    "Because the higher the hero level, the more the experience needed to level up, the experience bonus is more relevant the lower its user's level. For example, a hero that is nearly lvl 5 can use Tome to jump all the way to level 6, while a hero that is lvl 24 might receive about 1\/3 of a level from the same tome.",
    "It is recommended that your team allow the first tome to be consumed by someone that is not yet Lvl 6. Ideally, they then use their newly acquired ultimate ability to make a play (such as, to kill an enemy hero) for immediate pay-off.",
    "What your team uses any further tomes for is more debatable. Tomes can be used to put your core heroes even further ahead, or they can be used to help your lower-leveled heroes catch up. In general, they should be used to help your team achieve key hero levels, to reach higher level ultimates and talents."

  "tips": [
    "Aeon Disk can be a good choice for tanks, initiators\/counter-initiators or supports who have strong defensive abilities.",
    "Aeon Disk is effective against heroes that rely on ambush and\/or disables followed up by quick, sudden bursts of damage to finish their prey off, wasting their efforts (and possibly lengthy cooldowns), and allowing their target to escape quickly. Such heroes include Nyx Assassin, Skywrath Mage, Necrophos or Templar Assassin. Conversely, heroes that rely on quick bursts of damage may be better off not buying Aeon Disk, as they could waste their own spells upon attempted retaliation. Aeon Disk also provides protection from heroes with strong initiation tools like Earthshaker or Magnus, as (most of) their disable durations will be reduced and their team cannot provide immediate follow-up damage to their initiation.",

    "Aeon Disk also provides protection from heroes with strong initiation tools like Earthshaker or Magnus, as (most of) their disable durations will be reduced and their team cannot provide immediate follow-up damage to their initiation.",
    "Consider purchasing a Blink Dagger or other mobility items with Aeon Disk, as one can use it during Combo Breaker's duration, allowing a quick escape, provided it has not been disabled beforehand. It can also be used to initiate with, protecting you should you either miss your ability or if there are enemy heroes that you missed.",
    "Summoned units are not affected by the outgoing damage negation by Combo Breaker. Heroes such as Witch Doctor, Shadow Shaman or Lone Druid can still be able to retaliate on their attacker while being briefly protected.",
    "Other protective items like Linken's Sphere or Black King Bar can help delay Combo Breaker's activation in a teamfight, preventing it from being wasted by either a stray spell or a long-distance attack.",
    "The item can save a split pusher from getting killed while being far from his team to run back or teleport to base.",
    "Aeon Disk might not be a good choice against disables that can't be dispelled like Black Hole, Chronosphere, Static Storm, Doom, etc. It can also be dispelled by Nullifier which makes it less effective in the late game.",
    "Techies mines deal full damage while they are under the effect of Combo Breaker."

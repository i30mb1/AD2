        "The bonus attack damage is considered as a conditional attack damage bonus. Although the attack damage bonus values are not displayed in the HUD, it is still considered and directly added to the wielder's attack damage. The attack damage bonus values are considered by lifesteal, critical strike, and cleave, and it can be reduced only by flat reductions (e.g. damage block). Since it is considered bonus attack damage, it is not affected by percentage-based attack damage bonuses or reductions.",

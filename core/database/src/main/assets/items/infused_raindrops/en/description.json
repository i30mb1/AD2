  "tips": [
    "Works well against heroes who harass early lanes with magical damage, especially against those with stronger nukes and a high mana cost, like Queen of Pain, Leshrac, Lich, Visage and Lina.",
    "It is also good against lower nukes, like Storm Spirit's abilities, Arc Lightning and Arcane Bolt, although these abilities are in return able to burn through raindrops faster than the heavy nukes. This also applies to Maelstrom's and its upgrade's Chain Lightning.",
    "Since it ignores damage instances below 75, it is not effective against most damage over time abilities, like the ones from Viper, Warlock, Jakiro and Huskar. Infused Raindrops is also not very effective against damage over time which deals just high enough damage to proc it, as one such spell can proc Raindrop multiple times throughout its duration, wasting charges on rather low damage ticks, as compared to burst damage. Abilities like Venomous Gale and Shadow Strike are long lasting damage over time abilities which can easily use up 2 charges per cast, with just minimal damage getting blocked. Shorter effects like Frostbite, or enough stacks of Burning Spear are also able to waste charges, as they deal the minimum required damage to proc it, allowing enemies to throw higher damage nukes while the item is on cooldown.",

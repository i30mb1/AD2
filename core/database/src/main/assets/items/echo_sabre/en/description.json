    "The best items in combination to increase your damage are those which grant critical hit and armor reduction. A Skull Basher is also good to get a chance to bash from the two quick attacks. You can combine the echo sabre with a Daedalus and Satanic's active to instantly restore your HP.",
    "You can combine the echo sabre with a Daedalus and Satanic's active to instantly restore your HP.",
    "Echo Sabre's ability is effectively a passive 1-hit-only Overpower. This makes it a great item on heroes whose passive abilities rely on attack speed to be effective, similar to how Ursa's Fury Swipes relies on the attack speed of Overpower.",
    "The attack speed from the passive proc lasts until a second attack is done. This makes it possible to \"store\" the massive attack speed bonus for a planned strike on an enemy. One just has to attack a creep to proc the passive ability and immediately cancel the second attack. The stored attack speed can come very handy when ganking enemies which have strong attack speed slows like Enchantress with her Untouchable or Phoenix's Fire Spirits."

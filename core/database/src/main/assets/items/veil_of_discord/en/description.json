    "Consider how much spell damage your team produces when deciding whether or not to buy Veil of Discord.",
    "Veil of Discord can be a good purchase if your team overall outputs a good amount of spell damage, even if your own hero doesn't. Due to changes to Spell immunity and improved range of Magic Weakness, it can be a reliable item by all means.",
    "It compliments nicely for armor reducing debuffs for casters that deal physical damage with their spells. Also benefits as pure and magical damage.",
    "Knowing the potentials about magic resistance and armor of the enemy is the main allure of this item. Early game, before anyone can buy a magic resistance artifact or armor, reach their defensive talents or stack enough strength or agility to resist the spell effects lategame; is when Veil of Discord is most destructive.",
    "Thinking standard 25-30% magic resistance of heroes and no other sources to amplify it further; Magic Weakness treats target as 10-15% magic resistance lost. All inflicted targets incur magical damage at 85-90% efficiency along the duration depends on their stats.",
    "For physical damage spells, it is roughly equivalent to reducing armor by 3.5 points."
